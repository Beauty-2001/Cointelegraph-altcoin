According to an update from the popular blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, the lone trader paid an astonishing $119,157 in Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 to complete a Uniswap trade that swapped 84 Wrapped Ether (WETH) for 13.8 billion FOUR tokens.

It appears as though the trader voluntarily increased their gas fee to speed up the transaction time to purchase the memecoin. According to pseudonymous Twitter user FlurETH, the trader in question is sitting on 133 ETH ($245,667) in unrealized profit on their investment in the memecoin.

Gas fees on the Ethereum network have become the subject of debate amongst the crypto community, with a number of prominent Etheruem advocates praising the heightened activity for its revenue generating effects and long-term deflationary pressure on the supply of Ether.

Others have leveled criticism at the fees, claiming that unless the network becomes more “affordable” mass adoption will never be achieved.

As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase in Ethereum gas fees comes from the recent memecoin mania, driven in large part by the frenzied buying of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE). At the time of publication, the average Ethereum transaction fee is sitting at $22.98, the highest level recorded since May 12, 2022, when the average fee reached a peak of $31.11.

Another major reason behind the drastic uptick in gas fees comes from the maximal extractable value trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades en masse. The notorious MEV bot and “sandwich” attacker, known only by the pseudonym jaredfromsubway.eth, has been profiting significantly from the heightened network use.

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

On April 18, Jared cleared a whopping $950,000 in profits from the sandwich attacks. Jared has also been one of the largest gas spenders on the Ethereum network. On April 20, Jared used 7% of the total gas on the network and spent 455 ETH in transaction fees.

"What are liquidity provider (LP) tokens, and how do they work?","Providing liquidity to a pool could be another source of passive income in crypto. Find out here what liquidity provider tokens are and how they work.","1.
What are LP tokens?

Liquidity providers deposit assets into a pool to facilitate trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) and receive liquidity pool tokens (LP) in return. 

Liquidity pool tokens are also called liquidity provider tokens. They act as a receipt for the liquidity provider, who will use them to claim their original stake and interest earned. These tokens represent one’s share of the fees earned by the liquidity pool.

LP tokens have other use cases besides unlocking the provided liquidity. They allow the liquidity provider to access crypto loans, transfer ownership of the staked liquidity, and can earn compound interest in yield farming. Compound interest is interest earned on the original sum deposited. For example, 10% annual interest on $1,000 is $100, while the compound interest in the second year is calculated at $1,100, so it will be $110. 

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) grant their users full custody of their locked assets through LP tokens, and most allow users to withdraw them at any time after redeeming the interest earned.

From a technical standpoint, LP tokens are the same as other blockchain-based tokens. For example, LP tokens issued on DEXs that run on Ethereum will be ERC-20 tokens. Other liquidity provider token examples are the SushiSwap Liquidity Provider (SLP) tokens on SushiSwap and the Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT) on Balancer.

2.
What are liquidity providers?

In decentralized finance (DeFi), most tokens have small market caps and low DeFi liquidity with little availability, and finding a counterpart to match an order may be challenging. This is where liquidity providers become essential.

Liquidity makes it handy to buy or sell any given asset in a market without impacting price changes. Highly liquid assets have many buyers and sellers in the market, facilitating fast-execution trades at a minimal cost. In contrast, low-liquid assets have fewer buyers and sellers, making it more challenging to execute trades, which can lead to price slippage or high transaction costs.

Liquidity providers deposit two token pairs into a liquidity pool. Once deposited, they can swap between the tokens and charge a small fee for users who swap using their tokens.

Platforms such as Uniswap, Curve and Balancer are also called AMMs and are a fundamental component of DeFi. They are based on LP tokens necessary to allow platform decentralization and serve customers in a noncustodial way. They do not hold on to users’ tokens, but the automated functions will enable them to be fair and decentralized. 

For providing assets like Ether (ETH) to the pool, liquidity providers receive LP tokens representing their pool share, which will be used to claim any interest earned from transactions. LP tokens are always under the providers’ control, who decide when and where to withdraw their pool share.

3.
How do LP tokens work?

Once crypto users decide to invest in LP tokens, they can choose the liquidity pool and start depositing crypto assets to receive LP tokens in return. 

The LP tokens received are in proportion to the amount of liquidity provided, so if a user provides 10% of the liquidity to the pool, they’ll be issued 10% of the LP native tokens in that pool. The tokens will be added to the wallet used for liquidity and can be withdrawn along with interest earned at any time.

Providing liquidity to a centralized platform doesn’t generate LP tokens since the assets deposited are under the platform’s custody. On the other hand, DEXs and AMMs use LP tokens to remain noncustodial.

LP tokens should always be kept safe like any other crypto asset, as losing them means investors will lose their share of the pool. Still, LP tokens can be freely moved around different decentralized applications (DApps), and only withdrawing from the pool means losing the right to the share of the liquidity pool.

4.
How to get LP tokens?

Only liquidity providers can get LP tokens by contributing to the DEX platform liquidity with their crypto assets.

Plenty of DApps can be chosen to provide liquidity and receive LP tokens. From AMMs to DEXs, the LP token system is relatively common to many protocols. 

Platforms such as PancakeSwap, SushiSwap or Uniswap offer liquidity pools where users lock up crypto assets into smart contracts. Traders use that pool to trade their cryptocurrency, even the little-volume tokens.

LP tokens are mainly associated with decentralized platforms because they should preserve the protocol’s safety and decentralization. It’s possible to provide liquidity to a centralized exchange; however, the deposited assets will be kept under the control of the custodial service provider without returning any tokens.

5.
What are the use cases of LP tokens?

Other than representing a claim of one’s assets, LP tokens can be used across multiple DeFi platforms in ways that can accrue the investment’s value.

How do LP tokens gain value? They gain value as a fundamental component of DeFi, contributing to the smooth operation of the DEXs and AMMs used by these DApps. 

One primary source of passive income for liquidity providers is the share of transaction-generated fees earned by the liquidity pool in proportion to their investment share.

There are other use cases and streams of revenue for LP tokens. Here’s an overview of the main ones.

Collateral in a loan

Some cryptocurrency platforms, like Aave, allow liquidity providers to use their LP tokens as collateral to secure a crypto loan. Crypto lending has become a substantial component of DeFi, allowing borrowers to use their crypto as collateral and lenders to earn interest from their borrowers. 

LP tokens used as collateral are still an emerging trend, and only a few platforms offer the service. Such a financial tool is highly risky, and if a certain collateral ratio is not kept, borrowers may lose their assets by being liquidated.

Yield farming

Yield farming is the practice of depositing LP tokens in a yield farm or compounder to earn rewards. Investors can move their tokens manually using different protocols and receive LP tokens when they deposit them on another platform. 

Alternatively, they can use the liquidity pools of protocols like Aave or Yearn.finance, which help liquidity providers earn compounded interest more efficiently than humans.

Such a system allows users to share expensive transaction fees and use different compound strategies according to the effort and time they want to dedicate to this type of investment. One example of a compound strategy is lending out cryptocurrency on a platform that pays interest, and then reinvesting that interest back into the original cryptocurrency to potentially increase returns. Another example is using an algorithmic trading strategy to automate buying and selling of assets to generate profits that can be reinvested.

LP staking

Liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens to gain extra profit. It occurs when users transfer their LP assets to an LP staking pool in exchange for rewards of new tokens, just like how the bank pays interest on a savings account. It also incentivizes tokenholders to provide liquidity. Early stakers in a project can earn a very high annual percentage yield (APY), which decreases as more LP tokens are staked in the pool. 

Where to stake LP tokens 

LP tokens function the same way as other tokens supported by a blockchain network. For example, tokens issued on an Ethereum-based platform like Uniswap is an ERC-20 token and can be staked like any other token of the same kind. 

6.
Are LP tokens risky?

Some of the risks associated with holding cryptocurrency apply to LP tokens also. Taking special measures to protect one’s assets should always be a primary security concern.

Loss or theft 

Just like with cryptocurrency, LP tokens should be kept safe at all times and preferably stored in a hardware wallet, especially if the owner has a good amount of them. By losing access to a wallet — through a lost or stolen private key — the liquidity provider loses access to their LP tokens, their share of the liquidity pool and any interest gained.

Smart contract failure 

When supplying liquidity, a provider locks up their assets in a smart contract, which is always vulnerable to cyberattacks and fails if compromised. Despite massive improvements in the last few years, smart contracts have yet to become secure cryptocurrency tools. 

Therefore, choosing DeFi protocols with a strong network’s smart contracts is imperative. If the liquidity pool is compromised due to a smart contract failure, LP tokens can no longer return the liquidity to the owner. 

Impermanent loss

One of the most significant risks for LP tokens is impermanent loss, which occurs when the amount of assets deposited by liquidity providers exceeds the value they withdraw upon exiting the pool due to price changes over time. The best way to mitigate such risk is to choose stablecoin pairs when providing liquidity because they move within a smaller price range.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens-and-how-do-they-work"

According to blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, one crypto “whale” purchased 962.3 billion PEPE using 70 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and 470 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 for an average price of $0.000003122 on May 5.

PEPE has, however, fallen 42% from its all-time high since then, according to CoinGecko. The crypto investor’s PEPE holdings are now estimated to be worth only $2.4 million, marking an unrealized loss of more than $600,000.

Despite the recent price decline, PEPE still holds a market capitalization of just over $1 billion, making it the 45th-largest cryptocurrency by overall valuation.

Since its inception on April 14, PEPE has attracted widespread attention, witnessing over $636 million in trading volume within the last 24 hours, and single-handedly burning more than 5,000 ETH in related gas fees via Uniswap trading as of May 5.

While the memecoin has witnessed extreme volatility in its price, the number of individual holders has increased steadily over the past three weeks. According to data from Dune Analytics, there are 144,534 individual holders of tokens at the time of publication.

The advent of memecoin mania has also driven fees on the Bitcoin network to surge to their highest levels of the last two years, following an enormous spike in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20-related transactions.

Memecoins have played a role in the cryptocurrency industry since the creation of the most widely recognized meme-based cryptocurrency, Dogecoin

With memecoins having captured the attention of the wider crypto industry in recent weeks, a viral video has emerged detailing just how easy it is for anyone with an internet connection to create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch. 

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

A May 6 video from digital artist Johnny Shankman — who goes by whitelights.eth on Twitter — shows him completing a “speedrun” of creating and deploying an entirely new token, humorously dubbed “EASY_MONEY,” in just 27 seconds. The record was then beaten just a day later, clocking in at 22.45 seconds. 

The term “speed run” originates from the gaming community and is typically used in reference to completing a game, or level in a game, as quickly as possible. 

In the now-viral video, Shankman shows how any user can quickly create a new token by utilizing a program called Contracts Wizard, created by the crypto cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin. The Contacts Wizard tool generates code for an ERC-20 token with a few quick clicks of a cursor. On the program, users can select a number of potential features for their token.

After the code has been created, Shankman then uses an application called Remix, which compiles the token’s smart contract and deploys it on a given blockchain network. In the video, Shankman opts for deploying his EASY_MONEY (EZ) token on the Ethereum testnet.

He notes in the comments section that the video was “for educational purposes only” and clarifies that by deploying EASY_MONEY on the Ethereum testnet, it is not a real token to be speculated on.

Notably, Shankman’s video was picked up by a number of large accounts on Crypto Twitter, being reposted by the likes of Loopifyyy, which has now seen the video gain more than 3 million views across a series of different accounts.

The viral popularity of Shankman’s post comes at a time where “shitcoins'' have gained drastically in popularity throughout the broader crypto ecosystem. The recent memecoin boom has been led in large part by an “entirely useless” frog-themed token called Pepe, which has seen its value surge more than 5,000% since its inception on April 14.

In a follow-up comment, Shankman pointed out that someone had actually created a token with the same name as his explainer but divulged that he “did not make it” and he would “not be buying it.”

Less than 24 hours later, a new video emerged from another account on Twitter, that showed the same process being completed in just 22.45 seconds, setting a new unofficial record for the memecoin speedrun.

"Quadratic funding: The future of crowdfunding, explained","Quadratic funding is a new approach to crowdfunding that incentivizes smaller contributions and promotes the funding of diverse, high-quality projects.","1.
What is quadratic funding?

Quadratic funding is a democratic crowdfunding mechanism that aims to promote fair, inclusive funding for public goods, such as open-source software, scientific research and public art projects.

The idea behind quadratic funding is to combine modest individual contributions with larger matching sums from sponsors or contributors. With quadratic funding, each donor’s contribution is matched by the total amount generated, the number of distinct contributors and the total amount donated. 

As a result, contributions made by more people are matched more generously than contributions made by fewer people. This strategy encourages a more significant number of modest donations rather than a limited number of significant ones from affluent individuals or organizations to improve diversity and fairness.

As quadratic funding adheres to the principles of decentralization and community involvement, it has become increasingly popular within the blockchain and cryptocurrency communities. Quadratic funding guarantees that funding is allocated more equitably and transparently, with decisions made based on the will of the community rather than the interests of a few wealthy donors, incentivizing small payments from a large number of people.

For instance, the Gitcoin platform uses a quadratic formula to allocate funds, which rewards projects that receive a high number of small contributions. This promotes the funding of smaller, underrepresented projects and helps support the open-source community’s growth and development.

2.
How quadratic funding democratizes funding for public goods?

Unlike traditional fundraising, which tends to favor large donors, quadratic funding is designed to match small donations with a larger pool of funds to give everyone an equal voice in deciding which public goods to fund.

At its core, quadratic funding relies on a straightforward formula that pairs modest contributions with a bigger pot of money to reward well-supported initiatives with more funding. The formula is set up to give smaller donations greater weight, leveling the playing field and ensuring public goods are funded based on community support rather than the interests of a small number of affluent donors.

The following steps demonstrate how quadratic funding can democratize funding for public goods:

Create a matching pool of funds: Money is set aside in a matching pool used to match donations made for public goods.
Invite community support for donations: The community is encouraged to contribute to the public assets they value.
Use a quadratic formula to distribute matching funds: The matching pool of funds is distributed using a quadratic formula that gives smaller contributions more weight. The quadratic formula, for instance, would give the project with 100 donations of $10 each more matching funds because it has more favored donors than the project with 10 donations of $100 each.
Distribute funds to public goods: The matching funds are then distributed to the public goods based on the formula’s allocation.

Quadratic funding can aid in ensuring that open-source software projects and other public goods receive funding in line with their appeal and value to the community by democratizing allocation.

Smaller projects that might not have the backing of major funders but are nonetheless significant to the community can significantly benefit from this. In addition, by enabling developers to pool resources and work on joint projects, quadratic funding can encourage cooperation and teamwork among developers.

3.
How can quadratic funding support journalism?

In theory, quadratic funding could be an effective way to support journalism by encouraging a diverse range of people to contribute to creating news and sharing information.

Regardless of their financial resources, a broad spectrum of people can be encouraged to contribute to journalism through quadratic funding. By increasing the diversity of viewpoints and voices in journalism, the quality and usefulness of the information can be improved.

Quadratic financing can encourage journalists to create high-quality content by paying for efforts that garner community support. This incentivizes the production of journalism of the highest caliber. Accuracy, depth and investigative reporting can be encouraged, resulting in better informed, involved citizens.

Large donors who might have predetermined goals or prejudices that could skew journalism’s messages and content can be less influential because of quadratic funding. Quadratic funding can ensure that the allocation is more representative of the community’s views and interests by depending on a wide base of modest donations.

Quadratic fundraising platforms can encourage transparency by making it obvious how donations are distributed and enabling users to follow the development of funded projects. This can boost public confidence in journalism and foster closer ties between journalists and their readers.

While quadratic funding encourages a diverse range of contributors, promotes high-quality content and lessens the influence of large donors, it also has drawbacks, such as difficulty determining the impact of journalism, the possibility of abuse, a lack of diversity, and the need for infrastructure and resources. Notwithstanding these difficulties, quadratic finance has the potential to be a useful instrument for sustaining journalism, but its conception and application need to be carefully thought out.

4.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of quadratic funding?

Quadratic funding has the potential to be a valuable tool for motivating a variety of contributors, encouraging top-notch work and limiting the impact of significant funders. Careful consideration must be given to its design and implementation to overcome potential drawbacks, including assessing impact and the possibility of misuse.

Here are the advantages of quadratic funding:

Encourages a wide variety of contributors: Quadratic funding can encourage a wide range of people to donate, regardless of their financial resources, by providing matching funds for little contributions.
Incentivizes high-quality work: Quadratic financing can encourage the production of high-quality work by rewarding contributions that generate a lot of positive feedback from the public.
Reduces the influence of large donors: Quadratic funding can lessen the impact of wealthy donors with predetermined goals or biases that could skew the distribution of funds.
Supports transparency: By making it apparent how donations are distributed and enabling users to follow the development of funded projects, quadratic fundraising platforms can be created to encourage openness.

Although quadratic funding has many pros, it has some disadvantages too:

Difficulty in measuring impact: Impact measurement is problematic because it can be arbitrary and complicated, making it challenging to distribute resources wisely.
Possibility for abuse: There is a chance that dishonest people will try to take advantage of the quadratic funding scheme by forging donations or working together to raise their own contributions.
Lack of diversity: The types of materials that obtain funding under quadratic funding may still be influenced by the prejudices and preferences of the larger community.
Need for infrastructure and resources: Establishing a quadratic fundraising system involves costly infrastructure and investment to build and maintain the platform — and inform and entice potential donors — limiting its accessibility to people or organizations with the financial resources to fund it.
5.
What role could blockchain technology play in the future of quadratic funding?

In the future, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of quadratic funding. 

Blockchain technology can alleviate some possible issues and restrictions with the present system by offering a safe, open, and unchangeable record of donations and funding distributions. Blockchain-based smart contracts can automate the entire funding process, lowering the risk of abuse and system manipulation and ensuring that funds are distributed equitably and openly.

Additionally, the decentralization enabled by blockchain technology can increase the accessibility of quadratic funding for smaller, less-resourced groups and the participation of more diverse communities. In light of this, blockchain technology can potentially be an important tool for supporting diverse, high-quality content and quadratic funding in the future.

Blockchain can enable the creation of tokens that represent contributions to a project, allowing for more efficient tracking and transfer of funds. Moreover, a distributed ledger effectively generates a digital asset that can be tracked and transferred more effectively when used to produce tokens for donations to a project. These tokens, representing a contributor’s interest in the project or overall financing pool, can be used as currency.

Contributors who use tokens can more easily keep track of their efforts and, if they so desire, transfer their tokens to other contributors or different projects. By providing donors with an actual physical representation of their commitment to a project, tokens can also aid in encouraging donations.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/quadratic-funding-the-future-of-crowdfunding-explained"

A bot initiated the hack on BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deployments losing over $5 million. Twitter users claimed the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause.

The protocol confirmed the attack, paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. “We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,” said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a “comprehensive recovery and redemption plan” will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.

DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.

It is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai

US Justice Department investigating Binance for violating Russian sanctions: Report

The DOJ’s national security and crime divisions are both looking at the cryptocurrency exchange’s provision of services to Russians, Bloomberg reports.

Binance is under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) national security division for allowing Russians to use the cryptocurrency exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions, according to a report that appeared in Bloomberg on May 5. There have been no accusations against the company or its executive in connection with the investigation.

The national security probe is being carried out in tandem with a criminal division investigation, the news service said, citing five unnamed sources. Binance is the object of several investigations in the United States, including a DOJ inquiry into Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

Binance limited services to Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022. Still, it continued operating there, blocking only areas of Ukraine that were no longer under government control and servicing only non-sanctioned individuals, according to a company executive speaking to Cointelegraph.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Binance was used illegally to let Russians skirt US sanctions and move money through the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange https://t.co/AVgG55iSmx

— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) May 5, 2023

Binance has also been accused of Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML violations in a suit brought by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission in March.

The company did not reply immediately to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, but it told Bloomberg in a statement that it was compliant with U.S. and international sanctions, and its KYC protocols are in line with those of traditional banking. Every customer is subject to identity and residency checks, it said. Furthermore:

“Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.”

In addition, according to Bloomberg, Binance “has been in discussions” with the DOJ about complaints that it had violated a previous version of sanctions against Iran.

Binance is not the only crypto exchange to face sanctions violation scrutiny. Poloniex paid a $7.6 million settlement to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for violating sanctions against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to a May 1 announcement.

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain’s state.

The change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.

After broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

Regular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.
Contract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the “to” address is a smart contract address).
Contract-deployment transactions: transactions with no “to” address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract’s code).
How to check the status of an Ethereum transaction

Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:

Step 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer

Some blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others.

Step 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer’s search field

On Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says “All Filters.” Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name.

The txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.

Depending on the platform, it can also be called a “hash” or “txn hash.” It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the “Activity” tab and selecting the transaction.

Other than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.

Step 3: Click the icon for “search” or “enter” on the blockchain explorer

Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not

How to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say “success” or “successful.”

If there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.

In the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:

Error message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying “bad instruction” or “out of gas” means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an “out of gas” error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.
Reverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.
Transaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn’t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn’t appear on multiple ones, there’s a good chance it did not go through.
Pending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer’s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.

How long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?

An average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.

Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it’s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.

However, there’s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.

When a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum’s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.

Once a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.

By checking a transaction’s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.

Why should traders check a transaction’s status?

Ethereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.

Network congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise — the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction’s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.

It can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.

Such transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.

In addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:

Timestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.
Block confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.
Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.
ETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.
Base fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.
Gas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.
Nonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user’s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.

By being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction’s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage.

SEC issues record whistleblower award of $279M

The $279 million figure is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its largest-ever whistleblower award totaling $279 million.

The SEC generally issues awards ranging between 10% to 30% of collected monetary sanctions larger than $1 million. To receive such an award, the whistleblower must provide information that directly assists the SEC in successfully imposing enforcement actions on a particular case.

In a May 5 statement, the SEC noted that the $279 million awarded to the unnamed whistleblower was more than double the previous record of $114 million from back in October 2020.

Additionally, the $279 million figure awarded in this latest case is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

“The size of today’s award — the highest in our program’s history — not only incentivizes whistleblowers to come forward with accurate information about potential securities law violations, but also reflects the tremendous success of our whistleblower program,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.

These awards come from an investor protection fund established by the U.S. Congress. It is funded via collected monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators and does not come from funds that are owed to harmed investors.

In these circumstances, the SEC does not refer to the specific case the whistleblower award relates to or the name of the whistleblower to protect their privacy.

As such, it is unclear if this relates to a major securities violation from the crypto sector or Wall Street.

Regarding the whistleblower, the SEC did note that they helped provide key info on a case it was already working on.

“The whistleblower’s sustained assistance, including multiple interviews and written submissions, was critical to the success of these actions,” noted Creola Kelly, the chief of the SEC’s office of the whistleblower.

“While the whistleblower’s information did not prompt the opening of the Commission’s investigation, their information expanded the scope of misconduct charged,” she added.

The SEC’s whistleblower incentive program was established in mid-2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law by former President Barack Obama.

Confidence in the United States financial system seems to be eroding fast, with investors trying to find the next weakest link that is about to collapse. Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund management firm Pershing Square, cautioned that time was running out to fix the problem.

The U.S. equities markets have become vulnerable to adverse news on the regional banks, as seen from the sell-off in the past three days. Compared to that, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,797

 has held strong and is hovering near its critical overhead resistance at $31,000.

Bitcoin is not the only outperformer. Gold had risen close to its all-time high during the week. This shows that Bitcoin is currently behaving as a safe-haven asset and investors are adding it to their portfolios along with gold.

Could Bitcoin overcome the barrier at $31,000 and extend the up move? Will the altcoins follow Bitcoin higher? Studying the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies can help answer these questions.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Usually, the trend that was in force before the formation of the triangle tends to resume. That means the price is likely to break out to the upside.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price closes above the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $32,400. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level because if the bulls drive the price above $32,400, the rally could reach $40,000.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may continue its random price action inside the triangle for a few more days.

A break and close below the triangle will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then tumble to $25,250.

Ethereum price analysis

The bulls pushed Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 5. This shows that the bulls absorbed the supply and have come out on top.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could first rise to $2,000 and then attempt a rally to $2,200. The bears may aggressively defend this level because if they fail to do that, the pair may skyrocket toward $3,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then once again drop to the support line. A break below this level may sink the pair to the target objective of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $326 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may continue to oscillate inside the triangle for some more time.

A break below the triangle will indicate that bears have seized control. That is likely to start a downward move to $300 and then to the pattern target of $280. If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to propel the price above the triangle. That will clear the path for a possible rally to $350 and then $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 4 and a Doji candlestick pattern on May 5. This suggests that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not waging large bets.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, signaling that bears have a slight edge. The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support level at $0.43.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to the resistance line. Buyers will have to overcome this resistance to open up the possibility of a rally to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 dipped below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.38 on May 3 and 5, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support near $0.37.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers tried to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.39) on May 4, but the bears did not budge. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and crumbles below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then $0.30.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. That could increase the chances of a rally to $0.46 and later $0.52.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bulls have managed to keep Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 above the immediate support near $0.08, but they have failed to achieve a meaningful bounce off it. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A tight consolidation near a strong support level generally resolves to the downside. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.08) and the RSI in the negative zone also indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

If the support near $0.08 gives way, the DOGE/USDT pair may tumble to the next major support level of $0.07. This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers thrust the DOGE price above the downtrend line.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8798

 attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($1.02) on May 3 and 4, but the bears successfully protected the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near 43 suggest that the bears are in command. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern. That could start a down move toward $0.69.

Instead, if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the lower levels continue to attract buyers. The pair could then rally to the resistance line where the bears are again likely to sell aggressively.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 has been trading in a tight range for the past three days. This suggests a state of indecision among the buyers and sellers.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the SOL/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for some time. If the price slips and sustains below the 50-day SMA ($21.90), it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand in the near term. The pair could then slide to $18.70.

On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may start its march toward $24 and then $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Sellers yanked Polkadot 

DOT

$5.35

 below the $5.70 support level on May 3, but the long tail shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls again thwarted attempts by the bears to break the support on May 4 and 5.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The repeated failure to sustain the price below $5.70 may attract buyers. Bulls will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.96). If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($6.18). Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to gain the upper hand in the near term. The next target on the upside is $7.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies. The sellers will then again attempt to tug the price below $5.70 and challenge the crucial support at $5.15.

Litecoin price analysis

The long tail on Litecoin’s 

LTC

$80.35

 May 3 and 5 candlestick shows that the bulls continue to guard the $85 level with vigor, but they are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle at the moving averages.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The LTC/USDT pair is stuck in a tight range as the bulls are buying on dips while the bears are selling on rallies. The 20-day EMA ($89) is sloping down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears. A break below the $85 level will indicate that bears have taken control. The pair may then collapse to $75.

Instead, if buyers propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $96. If the price turns down from this level, it will point to possible range-bound action between $85 and $96 for a few days.

The price of Sui (SUI) has dropped sharply after its market debut across leading cryptocurrency exchanges.

On May 5, the SUI price was $1.26 per token, down about 70% from its record high of around $4, established two days ago on Binance.

Interestingly, on other exchanges like Kraken, the token’s market top was $1.60 or lower, suggesting it was in “price discovery” mode after the launch.

Still, SUI maintains its overall market gains, up nearly 1,200% from its market debut.

Early SUI price fundamentals

SUI’s initial uptrend drew support from traders who view Sui — a new entry into the long list of layer-1 blockchain projects — as potentially more scalable than its rivals.

Mysten Labs, Sui’s original contributor, asserts that it will become the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform thanks to its claims of processing about 300,000 transactions per second. In comparison, Solana handles up to 10,000 transactions per second.

Venture capitalists led by Andreessen Horowitz and FTX Ventures have invested $336 million in the Sui project via two investment rounds in 2021 and 2022. Mysten Labs confirmed that the rounds gave investors access to its firm’s equities, not SUI tokens.

However, the project’s token economics shows that it has allocated 14% of its 10 billion SUI supply to investors. Mysten Labs has not yet revealed when it will distribute these tokens or any associated vesting schedule.

Regarding FTX Ventures, a subsidiary of the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange, Mysten Labs repurchased the stake held by the firm in April 2023. Furthermore, it took back the rights to buy SUI tokens previously held by FTX for about $96 million.

SUI supply overload?

Traders and analysts have shown their conviction in the Sui project’s goals to become an attractive blockchain alternative. However, there are also concerns about SUI’s supply schedule.

Notably, the Sui Foundation plans to increase the SUI supply by approximately 15% by the end of 2023, which, according to analyst Dmitriy Lavrov, could prompt traders to wait for further price declines before entering the market.

From a short-term technical perspective, the SUI price faces interim sell-off pressure near $1.31.

A pullback scenario could have the token eye $1.26 as its short-term downside target. And suppose the oversupply scenario prevails. Then, the price could drop to $1.21 on May 5 or over the weekend, down 7% from current prices.

Conversely, analyst Ameba sees SUI rising toward $1.50 in May based on its decisive close above its descending trendline resistance. Fellow trader Crypto Mikey projects a similar uptrend for the Sui price.

Memecoins have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space since the inception of Dogecoin back in 2013, with fortunes made and ruined in equal measure. But a new token on the block caused a stir in recent weeks, as Pepe (PEPE) grabs a chunk of the memecoin market share from plucky investors.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, PEPE saw a 2,000% boom in value following its launch in late April 2023. The token’s rally is primarily attributed to zealous memecoin hype, with the project widely shared on Twitter over the past month.

The Pepe website itself is brandished with a closing disclaimer, labeling PEPE as “a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.“ The project also stipulates that it has no formal team or roadmap and that the token is “completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.“

Data analytics firm Nansen provided insightful data and key takeaways following the rise of PEPE’s market capitalization. Research analyst Xin Yi estimated that the total memecoin market value is around $20 billion, with the top five tokens, Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

, Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

, PEPE, Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) and Floki (FLOKI), accounting for over $18 billion of the value.

Data provided from Nansen Query shows the massive spike in token value and market capitalization of PEPE in relation to the other top five memecoins. Yi also notes that the infographic does not paint a complete picture, given that the data for PEPE reflects its listing on CoinGecko, which came a couple of weeks after its inception.

Yi told Cointelegraph that the social aspect of memecoins remains a significant driver of investor sentiment and action, highlighting the likes of Elon Musk’s infamous Dogecoin touts and rampant Twitter bots driving memecoin hashtags to relevance on Twitter:

“Since memecoins have no intrinsic value, it relies on catalysts such as social relevance and also events like 4/20, which is known as DOGE day, can affect the prices of the token as well.”

As previously explored, Nansen provides data analytics and insights into “smart money” cryptocurrency traders and holders by labeling wallets and tracking trades. The rise of PEPE has also attracted a significant number of smart money holders, as per on-chain data highlighted by Yi. She added that a few thousand traders might benefit from the surge in the value of memecoins, which is a gamble given that many other memecoins are pump-and-dump or rug-pull schemes:

“Nonetheless, gains on one good coin can easily surpass the cost of the other ‘failed’ coins, which is probably why these memecoins remain attractive for most traders to ape into. Hence, it really depends on the investor’s risk appetite.”

Nevertheless, Yi also pointed out that the inherent risk of memecoins often leads to liquidity crunches, where major tokenholders dump their holdings, leaving smaller investors reeling from losses.

The frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) surged over 85% in the last 24 hours to surpass a $1 billion market cap three weeks after its launch on April 14, 2023.

Ironically, the core value proposition of PEPE is that there isn’t one. The official website for the cryptocurrency features a disclaimer that describes investment in the token in the following manner:

“$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”

Currently, Pepe seems to be treading a similar path to its more well-known memecoin counterparts Dogecoin 

DOGE

 and Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

.

In 2021, DOGE surged by over 23,000%, mainly due to the vocal support for the token espoused by billionaire Elon Musk on Twitter.

Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 crypto bull market after using Dogecoin as a springboard for its popularity.

Due to the lack of any underlying fundamentals, investment in memecoins is high risk, and they are notorious for extreme volatility and major swings in value. A closer look at some of the on-chain activity from Pepe insiders points to some concerning trades.

According to data from the blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, five addresses allegedly linked to the Pepe team made a $1.23 million profit in a thin liquid market. They purchased 8.87 trillion PEPE at a low price and sold over 90% of their holdings on Uniswap for a gain.

It’s worth noting that some of the top PEPE holders are centralized exchanges. However, according to data tracked by analyst “008.eth,”non-exchange PEPE whales have reduced positions recently, hinting at profit-taking that coincided with a price correction on May 3.

Smart contract auditor CertiK claims to have blocked $160,000 from Merlin, a zkSync-based decentralized exchange that has been the center of a rogue insider “rugpull” that lost users $1.8 million last week.

CertiK shared the news of its successful $160,000 freeze of the stolen funds in an update to its 257,700 Twitter followers on May 5.

“We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners,” CertiK said, adding that they’re continuing to monitor the movement of the stolen funds:

We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners. We will continue to monitor the movement of all stolen funds in an attempt to freeze and recover the remaining amount.

— CertiK (@CertiK) May 4, 2023

The firm explained that it tried to “collaborate” with Merlin to recover the funds stolen from the April 25 “rug pull,” but the effort was to no avail.

It led the firm to reach out to law enforcement in the United States and the United Kingdom in an attempt to uncover the identities of the pseudonymous operators:

“This lack of cooperation has complicated our efforts to validate and aid victims. We are focusing on working with law enforcement and have submitted information to relevant US & UK agencies.”

“We are exploring all possibilities to fight exit scams with the $2M we’ve committed,” CertiK added.

The security firm believes the “rogue developers” are based in Europe, according to an earlier post.

As for the exit scam, CertiK said, “Merlin insiders abused the owner’s wallet privileges,” which is consistent with its initial finding that it came from a private key issue as opposed to an exploit.

Merlin claims the rug pull was carried out by its back-end team, which they claim to have put a “high degree of trust in.”

We are deeply saddened by the actions of the technical team, whom we put a high degree of trust in. Merlin will continue to support our community and resolve the issue.

CertiK, on the other hand, attributed part of the blame to themselves for failing to properly inform users of the centralization risks.

In a note to Cointelegraph, the firm said they would place more emphasis on this in future audit summaries.

“We are working to improve the clarity of our audit summaries in our reports — especially around centralization risks — and to better communicate with the community about the purpose of an audit.”

Going forward, CertiK will prioritize centralization risks in audit summaries to ensure users have a complete picture of potential risks.

We recognize that audit reports can be highly technical documents, and it’s our job to communicate the risks clearly and transparently.

— CertiK (@CertiK) May 4, 2023

CertiK however stressed that smart contract auditors shouldn’t be held fully responsible for failing to identify rug pulls:

“Code Audits serve the purpose of uncovering vulnerabilities, not to detect a potential rugpull. Its important to recognize that many projects both large and small have centralization issues flagged, and the vast majority do not result in a rugpull,” the firm said.

The firm launched a $2 million compensation plan to cover the funds lost as a result of the “exit scam” on April 27.

The firm added that the funds pledged will be used to prevent exit scams and assist victims where possible.

A moderator of the popular trading subreddit r/WallStreetBets has dumped a large portion of the WSB Coin (WSB), a token project that claims to be the official memecoin of Wall Street Bets.

On May 2, WSB was launched by people involved in moderating the WallStreetBets Reddit forum. The subreddit gained notoriety for the GameStop short squeeze, sending hedge funds to their knees in January 2021.

The creators of the WSB token claimed that there would be no allocation for the team and that 10% of the coins would be reserved for the subreddit. The website writes:

“It’s the fairest launch memecoin you will find with no team allocation and no presale. Just a free airdrop and some coins for the community. 10% of the $WSB supply is reserved as a treasury for the r/wallstreetbets sub to do with as they please.”

However, just days later, one of the token’s team members started to dump massive amounts of tokens. On May 4, on-chain detective ZachXBT tweeted that “zjz.eth,” who runs the moderation bots for the subreddit, has allegedly pulled the rug on WSB investors. On-chain data shows that zjz.eth has sold WSB coins in exchange for 334 Ether 

ETH

$1,855

, worth around $635,000 at the time of writing.

The token price dropped massively after the dump, going from an all-time high of $0.00067279 to an all-time low of $0.00004827 in two days. Community members warned people to refrain from buying the dip as the moderators still have access to 10% of the total supply.

DO NOT BUY THE $WSB DIP@zjzWSB is hard rugging, there will be no bounce. He has 10% of the supply and every single buy is his exit liquidity.

This is not a drill.https://t.co/H1c7NidXHI pic.twitter.com/bOKFFi97jU

— Eric Cryptoman (@EricCryptoman) May 4, 2023

Meanwhile, another moderator who goes by WSBmod has threatened to report those who were involved in the dump to the police and the FBI if they don’t reach out. The moderator urged zjz.eth to return the money. 

Cointelegraph tried to reach out to zjz.eth but did not get an immediate response.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has launched its native algorithmic United States dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum mainnet — minting more than $22 million worth of the crvUSD token so far.

According to data from blockchain explorer Etherscan, at time of writing on May 4, the contract had minted more than $22 million worth of crvUSD in the past eight hours, with $20 million of that amount minted within the first five minutes.

The deployment of crvUSD on the Ethereum network is a significant step toward the public release of the algorithmic stablecoin. Notably, the stablecoin remains inaccessible to general users, pending integration with Curve’s front-end user interface on its official website.

Responding to a query in the official Curve Finance Telegram chat about when users could expect to see the stablecoin released to the public, an admin claimed it would be coming “soon.”

As many figured - deployment of crvUSD smart contracts has happened!

This is not finalized yet because UI also needs to be deployed. Stay tuned!

— Curve Finance (@CurveFinance) May 3, 2023

At the time of publication, Curve Finance is one of the largest DeFi protocols in the industry, with roughly $4.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.

Algorithmic stablecoins became the focal point of industry-wide criticism following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, when the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its peg and the value of its sister token Terra — later renamed Terra Classic (LUNC) — plunged by more than 99%. UST’s value was maintained by a complex arbitrage mechanism that was eventually brought down by a group of sophisticated traders. 

Curve’s crvUSD differs from the now-defunct UST, utilizing a similar design similar to MakerDAO’s 

MKR

$675

 DAI 

DAI

$1.00

 stablecoin. According to the crvUSD whitepaper, crvUSD will function as a “collateralized-debt-position” stablecoin, meaning that users must deposit collateral in order to take out a loan in crvUSD. The preferred asset for use as collateral has not yet been specified by Curve Finance.

Curve isn’t the only DeFi protocol with its sights set on bringing an algorithmic stablecoin to market. Competitor protocol Aave (AAVE) released a testnet version of its “native decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin,” dubbed GHO, this past February.

Curve’s plan to release an algorithmic stablecoin was first announced by Curve Team member mrblocktw in a tweet on July 21, 2022.

— 區塊先生 ⚠️ (rock #58) (@mrblocktw) July 21, 2022

Later the same day, Curve’s founder, Michael Egorov confirmed that the stablecoin would be overcollateralized at the ReDeFine Tomorrow Web3 summit.

Following the launch of the new stablecoin, the protocol’s native Curve DAO (CRV) token spiked approximately 7% according to data from TradingView. CRV is currently changings hands for $0.96.

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Investors seem to have priced in a 25-basis-points rate hike by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3. Next, they will look for clues on the Fed’s actions for the rest of the year.

Will the Fed maintain its hawkish stance as inflation still remains well above its target range, or will the bank troubles and looming recession make the central bank signal a pause in its rate hikes?

The World Economic Forum's “Chief Economists Outlook” report released on May 1 shows that 80% of the chief economists surveyed believe that central banks have to maintain a delicate balance between “managing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability.” The economists anticipate that the central banks will find it difficult to bring down inflation to their target levels.

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, cautioned investors that investing in assets “outside of the traditional financial system” is the only way out if they want to preserve their capital.

Could Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

 and altcoins start an up-move after bouncing off key support levels? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern in Bitcoin. Generally, a symmetrical triangle acts as a continuation pattern and the price breaks out in the direction that was prevalent before the formation developed.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, it is better to wait for the price to complete the breakout before waging any new bets because sometimes, the setup behaves as a reversal pattern.

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,642) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price continues lower and breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a short-term corrective phase. The BTC/USDT pair may drop to $25,250. This level is likely to witness aggressive buying by the bulls.

Contrarily, if the price bounces off the support line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the resistance line. A break and close above the triangle will open the doors for a potential rally to $32,400.

Ether price analysis

Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 jumped off the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 1, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages and challenge the resistance line. If buyers kick the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $2,131. There is minor resistance at $2,000, but it is likely to be crossed.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair below the triangle. If they succeed in their endeavor, the pair may plunge to the pattern target of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 remains stuck inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers are trying to guard the support line of the triangle. If they manage to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($326), the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the resistance line. Traders will have to overcome this obstacle to signal the start of a new up-move.

Alternatively, if the price collapses below the triangle, it will suggest that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The pair may then slide to $300 and thereafter extend the fall to the pattern target of $280.

XRP price analysis

The long tail on the May 1 and 2 candlesticks shows that the bulls tried to start a recovery in XRP 

XRP

$0.43

. However, they could not sustain the buying pressure, and the price turned lower on May 3.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to extend the decline to the strong support at $0.43. This remains the key level to watch for in the near term. If this support crumbles, the XRP/USDT pair may drop to $0.36. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.

Instead, if the price turns up from $0.43 and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will signal that bulls are on a comeback. The pair could then rally to the resistance line. If buyers surmount this hurdle, the pair may surge to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

The bulls held Cardano’s ADA 

ADA

$0.366

 above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($0.38) on May 2, but they failed to overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA ($0.39).

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are trying to pounce on this opportunity and close the ADA/USDT pair below the 50-day SMA. There is minor support at $0.37, but if that cracks, the selling could pick up momentum, and the pair may slump to $0.33 and later to $0.30.

The important resistance on the upside is the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Buyers will have to drive the price above this level to signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair can then surge to $0.46.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 is struggling to bounce off the strong support near $0.08, which suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.08) is sloping down, and the RSI is below 42, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the support near $0.08 is breached, the DOGE/USDT pair could plummet to the next major support at $0.07.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly push the price above the downtrend line. The pair may then rally to $0.09 and thereafter dash toward the stiff overhead resistance at $0.11.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon’s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8803

 rebounded off the $0.94 support on May 2, indicating that the bulls are trying to aggressively protect the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($1.02) is sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. Sellers will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the MATIC/USDT pair may turn down and fall to $0.94.

The repeated retest of a support level within a short interval tends to weaken it. If this support gives way, the selling could intensify, and the pair may nosedive to $0.69. Buyers will have to kick the price above the resistance line to invalidate the bearish view.

Solana price analysis

Buyers defended the 50-day SMA ($21.78) on May 2, but they could not propel Solana’s SOL 

SOL

$21

 above the 20-day EMA ($22.26). This shows that the bears are selling on every minor rally.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have pulled the price below the 50-day SMA. If they sustain the breakdown, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the next strong support at $18.70. The possibility of a bounce off this level remains high. If that happens, the pair may stay range-bound between $18.70 and $27.12 for some more time.

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair could then rally to $24 and later dash to the overhead resistance at $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Polkadot’s DOT 

DOT

$5.36

 slipped below the $5.70 support on May 1, and the bears are trying to build upon this advantage on May 3.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls attempted a recovery on May 2, but the shallow bounce showed a lack of aggressive buying near $5.70. This suggests that the DOT/USDT pair may continue lower and reach the crucial support at $5.15.

Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to start a sustained recovery, they will have to quickly push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair may pick up momentum and rally toward $7.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($89) and the horizontal support at $85. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears hold the edge.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bears tug the price below $85, the selling could intensify, and the LTC/USDT pair may plunge to the strong support at $75. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break below it will open the doors for a further drop to $65.

Another possibility is that the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $96 and above it to $106.

New memecoin Pepe (PEPE) has entered a sharp correction phase after surging by more than 2,000% since its debut a few weeks ago.

On May 3, the PEPE price dropped to $0.00000089, down about 35% from its record high of $0.00000138 established two days earlier. As a result of the correction, its market capitalization slipped by nearly $80 million, pushing PEPE out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

A mix of technical and fundamental indicators hint at further downside for PEPE price.

Retail interest falls

PEPE’s daily trading volumes declined across centralized and decentralized exchanges as prices fell. The same occurred on Google Trends for the keyword “Pepe Coin,” whose score is down from 100 to 7 in a day, suggesting that the retail hype has subsided in the past 48 hours.

PEPE whale distribution is worrisome

The top 100 richest PEPE addresses, aka “whales,"" control 45% of the token’s circulating supply, according to data tracked by the website CoinCarp.

These 100 addresses might belong to 100 different individuals. But one entity can control more than one address, which gives a limited number of whales more say over the direction of PEPE future price trends, increasing risk of price manipulation.

For instance, Lookonchain revealed that five addresses allegedly linked to the Pepe team made a $1.23 million profit in a thin liquid market. They purchased 8.87 trillion PEPE tokens at a low price and sold over 90% of their holdings at a higher price on Uniswap.

Some of the top PEPE holders are centralized exchanges. But, according to data tracked by analyst 008.eth, non-exchange PEPE whales have reduced positions recently, hinting at profit-taking that coincided with the ongoing price correction.

20% PEPE correction ahead?

PEPE has rallied without any concrete fundamentals behind it, and the evidence of fewer whales controlling the uptrend could negate the gains in the short term. Technicals concur.

For instance, the four-hour chart shows that PEPE/USDT has formed higher highs, but its relative strength index (RSI) has formed lower highs since April 30. In other words, a bearish divergence that suggests PEPE's upside momentum will likely weaken in the short term.

In addition, PEPE appears on the road to its 50-4H exponential moving average (50-4H EMA; the red wave) near $0.0000047410, down 20% from current price levels.

A further break below the red wave could have the token test the $0.00000020-0.00000017 range as the next downside target.

Of course, the PEPE token is new and thus lacks adequate price history to anticipate its future price movements. Moreover, memecoins are notorious for their sharp volatility and major price moves. 

Dogecoin, for instance, has rallied 7,000% since 2020 thanks to vocal support from billionaire investor Elon Musk.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges around the world are launching trading of the Sui (SUI) token amid the Sui Network’s mainnet launch on May 3.

According to an official announcement by the Sui Foundation, the Sui mainnet went live at 12:00 pm UTC. Many global crypto trading platforms supported the Sui mainnet launch, enabling investors to buy and sell the new SUI token.

Crypto exchange Binance plans to debut SUI trading immediately after mainnet launch. The platform will allow users to trade between SUI and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

, Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 and BNB 

BNB

$314

 at 12:15 pm UTC. The firm will also enable investors to exchange SUI against euros and Turkish liras.

Other big exchanges, including Huobi, KuCoin, ByBit, OKX and Poloniex, also announced SUI listings. KuCoin noted that it also plans to list SUI/USDT-margined futures and isolated margin trading pair SUI/USDT when its “liquidity meets the requirement.”

Poloniex also emphasized that the total supply of SUI is capped at 10 billion tokens.

Some South Korean exchanges, known to face investigations by local authorities for listing certain native coins, have joined the global SUI hype. Upbit is one of those exchanges preparing to start SUI trading on May 3.

Shortly after the trading launch, the value of the SUI took a sharp dive to below $2. According to data from CoingGecko, SUI tanked 40% from its opening price. In the meantime, data from CoinMarketCap and Binance suggest that SUI even dropped more than 70%. The SUI token lost the majority of value in the first five minutes after the launch of trading.

At the time of writing, the token is trading at $1.29. SUI’s fully diluted market capitalization amounts to about $13 billion.

Even the current price of SUI is significantly higher than the price of the token during its spotlight token sale in April. During a token sale in mid-April, users of exchanges like KuCoin and OKX were able to buy SUI tokens at 0.1 USDT per coin.

Binance users deposited massive amounts of cryptocurrency to farm SUI tokens before the mainnet launch. According to data from Binance Launchpad, users of Binance staked nearly $4 billion in Binance Coin 

BNB

$314

 and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm 40 million SUI tokens. At the time of writing, the combined value of all these tokens amounts to $51 million.

What is SUI token?

Sui, or the Sui Network, is a layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed to increase Web3 adoption with fast speeds and high scalability.

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains — which run on proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, respectively — the Sui platform relies on delegated proof-of-stake. That means that SUI network users can elect and vote for delegates to confirm the next block.

The Sui project is famous for being built on Move, a new Rust-based programming language designed at Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Sui is backed by Mysten Labs, a Web3 infrastructure organization founded by former senior executives at Meta’s Novi Research.

After Meta shut down its crypto project Diem in 2022, Mysten Labs started actively working on the Sui network. In September 2022, the Sui Foundation announced a $300 million raise for the development of the Sui ecosystem.

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 can make some big gains versus Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

, particularly as its August halving event gets closer, according to Litecoin’s creator Charlie Lee.

Litecoin up 85% since record lows versus Bitcoin

Lee argues that LTC/BTC could rally to 0.025 BTC, or over 700%, in the next bull cycle, with Litecoin having “higher throughput by design, scalability with extension blocks, better fungibility and privacy from MWEB [MimbleWimble].“

“I can see an upside target of 10% (0.025 LTC/BTC). In the next bull market, 5% (0.0125) shouldn’t be too hard to achieve. I honestly don’t see it going much below 1% (0.0025) on the downside. The next halving will be in ~92 days. This is going to be fun.“

His statements appeared after Litecoin’s 85% price recovery from its record low of 0.001716 BTC in June 2022. LTC is still down about 90% below its record high of 0.051 BTC from November 2013, owing to rising competition in the altcoin market.

Litecoin halving looms

LTC’s recovery in recent months has been accompanied by growing buzz around its upcoming block reward halving.

The Litecoin block reward to miners will be cut by 50% from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC sometime in August 2023.

As a result, new LTC supply will drop by 50%, which should, at least in theory, make LTC more scarce on the market and, therefore, drive up its price.

Historically, the months leading to Litecoin halving typically prompted traders to accumulate LTC. For instance, the first halving event in August 2015 preceded a 450% price rally versus Bitcoin.

However, the months before the second halving event saw limited gains as Bitcoin’s crypto dominance grew amid the United States-China trade war. But, as a rule, LTC/BTC falls sharply after halving events, and the same could happen after August 2023.

LTC price technicals hint at a similar scenario, with LTC/BTC printing what appears to be a bear flag pattern, as shown below.

The pair may bounce toward the upper trendline of its bear flag, which coincided with the 50-3D exponential moving average (50-3D EMA; the red wave) near 0.0035 BTC ahead of the halving. But its bear flag target sits around 0.0024 BTC, down 20% from current price levels.

Litecoin price to $100 by June?

Litecoin has fared better versus the U.S. dollar in the months leading up to the last two halvings. LTC’s price grew about 250% ahead of the first halving and 500% ahead of the second when measured from their sessional lows, respectively. 

LTC/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView

The price has undergone a similar upside trajectory ahead of the August halving, with LTC up 120% from its sessional low of around $40. And it may continue to rise in the coming months, based on a mix of technical and on-chain indicators.

For instance, Litecoin is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to Glassnode’s MVRV-Z score of -0.139.

Related: Why is Litecoin price up today?

The MVRV-Z score represents the ratio between the market and realized cap. When the market value is significantly higher than realized value, it historically indicates a market top (red zone). Meanwhile, the opposite indicates market bottoms (green zone), as shown below.

Litecoin has entered the green zone, which typically precedes strong bullish reversals.

From a technical standpoint, LTC’s price is well-positioned for a rebound after retesting its multimonth ascending trendline as support.

In this case, LTC/USD can climb toward its horizontal resistance level near $100, up about 20% from current prices.

On May 2, European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares published its latest “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,” which stated that the digital asset market experienced bearish sentiment for the second consecutive week, resulting in outflows totaling $72 million. The report noted that the bearish sentiment could be attributed to the probability of further interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve this week.

According to the report, crypto market funds experienced outflows across all geographies and providers, particularly in Germany and Canada, where outflows reached $40 million and $14 million, respectively.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

 recorded the largest outflows at $46 million, with short-Bitcoin also experiencing outflows of $7.8 million, its highest figure since December 2022. Despite the recent outflows, short-Bitcoin continues to lead in inflows for the year, with net inflows of $119 million. Meanwhile, Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 products saw outflows amounting to $19 million, marking the biggest weekly outflows since the Merge in September 2022.

On a positive note, a small number of altcoin funds experienced minor inflows, with Solana 

SOL

$21

, Algorand 

ALGO

$0.17

 and Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8803

 each gaining less than $1 million in capital flows. 

Blockchain equities also experienced negative sentiment, resulting in outflows of $2.5 million last week, although the year-to-date net flows remain positive at $27 million.

CoinShares researcher James Butterfill authored the report. He wrote, ""Volumes remain subdued for the broader crypto market (50% less than year average) while ETP [exchange-traded products] investment product volumes at US$1.7bn for the week are 16% above the year average.""

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.

According to Hayes, due to the huge amount of public debt accumulated by the world’s largest economies, governments will have no choice other than ""inflating it away"" through money printing. 

Thus, the only way to escape the progressive destruction of fiat wealth is by acquiring assets outside the traditional financial system, such as crypto, the purchasing power of which doesn’t fall compared to the cost of energy. 

“My whole goal with all of my investing is to preserve capital so that I can consume the same amount of energy or whatever energy amount that I would like from now and into the future,” Hayes said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. 

However, the amount of crypto assets available is relatively small compared to the total amount of debt in the economy, which means that only a few will be able to preserve their capital as the majority see their wealth destroyed.

According to Hayes, the crypto crackdown in the United States reflects the government’s attempt to keep the masses within the traditional system by preventing them from fleeing to crypto.

“They want your capital to sit there and they'll make it a very pleasant, pleasant journey to lose 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% of your purchasing power over a period of time such that the debt load is effectively lowered and the finances are healthier,” he said.

JPMorgan Chase emerged as the winner in the auction to acquire the deposits and a “substantial majority of assets” of troubled bank First Republic. This marked the failure of the third regional bank in the United States since March and laid bare the vulnerabilities in the legacy banking system.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

 has risen for four consecutive months from January through April, a feat it last achieved in 2013. Will the recovery extend in May?

Historical data does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears in May. The performance is split right in the middle with five positive and five negative monthly closes in May, according to Coinglass data.

The recovery in Bitcoin is facing a stiff hurdle above $30,000, indicating that the bulls are wary of buying at higher levels. That could be because of the upcoming Fed meeting on May 2 and 3, which is known to cause an increase in short-term volatility.

What are the levels that the bulls need to defend on Bitcoin and select altcoins if they want to keep the chances alive for the continuation of the up move? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

S&P 500 index price analysis

The S&P 500 index (SPX) bounced off the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at 4,035 on April 26 and has reached the overhead resistance of 4,200 on May 1.

SPX daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are expected to mount a strong defense in the zone between 4,200 and 4,325. If the price turns down from the overhead zone but does not fall below the moving averages, it would suggest that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying the dips.

That would increase the likelihood of a break above 4,325. If that happens, the index could accelerate toward 4,500 and then 4,650.

If bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to quickly yank the price below the 50-day SMA. That could sink the index to the uptrend line.

U.S. dollar index price analysis

After trading between the 100.82 support and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 101.93 for the past few days, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) is trying to break out of the range.

DXY daily chart. Source: TradingView

The relative strength index (RSI) has been gradually rising toward the center, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the index could rally to the 50-day SMA (103.05).

Such a move would suggest that the index may extend its stay inside the 100.82 to 106 range for a few more days.

If bears want to strengthen their position further, they will have to tug the price below 100.82. That would complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, starting a possible downtrend toward 97.50.

Bitcoin price analysis

The long wick on Bitcoin’s April 30 candlestick chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $30,000.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price turned down and slumped on May 1 but a minor positive is that the bulls are fiercely protecting the 50-day SMA ($28,146). This suggests that the BTC/USDT pair may swing between $26,942 and $30,000 for a while.

Usually, a tight range of trading is followed by a range expansion. If the price continues lower and plunges below $26,942, the pair may decline to the crucial support level of $25,250.

On the contrary, if the range expands above $30,000, the pair is likely to rise to $31,000 and thereafter to $32,400. A break above this level would signal a pickup in momentum.

Ethereum price analysis

The bulls are struggling to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,896), indicating that the bears are trying to flip this level into resistance.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA has started to turn down gradually and the RSI has dipped below 45, indicating that bears have a slight edge. If bears sink the price and keep it below $1,785, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,663.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to propel the pair above the psychological level of $2,000. If they succeed, the pair can rally to the stiff overhead resistance level of $2,200.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($323) on April 30, indicating that the bulls continue to guard this level with full force.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the buyers and sellers. The 20-day EMA ($328) is sloping up gradually and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.

If buyers drive the price above the triangle, it would signal the start of a new up move. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to the pattern target of $380 and subsequently to $400.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the pair below the support line of the triangle and deepen the correction to $280.

XRP price analysis

XRP’s 

XRP

$0.43

 recovery hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($0.47) on April 29, which suggests that the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on rallies.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to pull the price to the strong support level of $0.43. This is an important level to keep an eye on because if it cracks, the XRP/USDT pair may collapse to the next major support level of $0.36.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. Such a move would suggest that the bears are losing their grip. That could open the doors for a possible rally to the resistance line. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could surge toward $0.56.

Cardano price analysis

Buyers are finding it difficult to push Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 above the neckline, indicating that the bears are fiercely protecting the level.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slip below the 50-day SMA ($0.38). The RSI is in negative territory and the 20-day EMA ($0.40) is flattening out, indicating that bears are trying to gain the upper hand.

If the ADA price plunges below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to the next support level of $0.33.

On the upside, the bulls will have to cross the obstacle at the neckline to set up a retest of $0.46. A break above this level would signal the start of a new uptrend.

MATIC

 is facing selling by the bears on relief rallies while the bulls are trying to defend support at $0.94.

This tight trading range is unlikely to continue for long. The down-sloping 20-day EMA ($1.03) and the RSI in negative territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears tug the price below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair could nosedive toward $0.69.

On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it would suggest the start of a stronger recovery. The pair may then rise to the resistance line, where the bulls will again face stiff pressure from the bears.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.08) on April 30, indicating that the sentiment is negative and bears are using the rallies to sell.

The price has reached support near $0.08. If this level gives way, it would suggest that bears have seized control. Sellers would then try to build upon their advantage and pull the DOGE/USDT pair to the next support level at $0.07. The bulls are expected to defend the zone between $0.07 and $0.06 with all their might.

Contrarily, if the price bounces off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it would suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. The upside momentum could pick up after buyers pierce the downtrend line. Dogecoin's price may then climb to $0.11.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 turned down from $24 on April 30, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. The price has reached the 50-day SMA ($21.74), which is an important level to keep an eye on.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The short-term advantage would tilt in favor of the bears if they manage to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. The SOL/USDT pair could then slump to the strong support level of $18.70. Buyers are likely to guard this level with force. If the price rebounds off $18.70, the bulls would again try to clear the hurdle at $24.

If they can pull it off, the pair could attempt a rally to $27.12. A downturn from this level may result in rangebound price action between $27.12 and $18.70 for some time. Alternatively, if the bulls catapult the price above $27.12, the next stop could be as high as $39.

On May 1, cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced that it would be listing memecoin Pepe (PEPE) at 17:00 Hong Kong Time (HKT) and open Pepe withdrawals on May 2 at 17:00 HKT. In supporting the listing decision, OKX staff wrote:

“Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character and internet meme created by cartoonist Matt Furie. Pepe was designed to be a green frog with a human-like body; this is one of the most popular memes in the world.”

Several cryptocurrency exchanges, including MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.io and Huobi, listed Pepe trading pairs two weeks prior, stirring what appears to be a trading frenzy. The token has returned 2,340% since April 17 and is now trading at $0.000001223 apiece at publication. Following news of the OKX listing, Pepe’s price has surged over 50% in the past 24 hours.

Created on the Ethereum blockchain by anonymous developers, the Pepe token was created, according to CoinMarketCap, “as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme,” with the aim of capitalizing on the popularity of memecoins such as Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

 and Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

.

In 2021, DOGE surged by over 23,000%, partly due to American business magnate Elon Musk’s vocal support for the coin on social media. Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull market after gaining tailwind popularity from its sister Dogecoin token. Despite the recent traction, OKX staff wrote in its Pepe listing announcement: 

“Digital assets are innovative investment products with high price fluctuations and risks. Before investing, [OKX] hopes you have a full understanding of digital assets, rationally judge your investment ability, and make investment decisions prudently.”

More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades

Starknet makes performance improvements a top priority in 2023, aiming to increase throughput, lower latency and reduce transaction costs.

Layer-2 blockchain protocols have been in the spotlight in 2023, bringing major performance improvements to a variety of platforms and services operating in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been key in the roll-out of a variety of layer 2s, with the technology pioneered by the decentralized scaling network Starknet. StarkWare, the technology firm behind the scaling platform, has outlined plans to further improve its layer-2 network to meet an expected increase in users and developers through the rest of the year.

Cointelegraph caught up with Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of StarkWare, to unpack key points set out in a 2023 roadmap for Starknet. Chief among a list of to-dos is performance improvements that are centered around higher throughput and reduced latency of Starknet’s network.

Ben-Sasson highlighted the focus on performance upgrades that are expected to deliver significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) than on Ethereum’s mainnet at lower gas costs:

“The most important thing is for builders and developers to have high throughput so that they can really build. Starknet is about increasing the computational abilities of Ethereum and we just want to provide this raw power to the hands of developers.”

Starknet v0.12.0 is expected to be released in the next month and is the culmination of a six-month sprint that involves transitioning Starknet’s development stack to a Rust-based Sequencer as well as an open-source project that has built a Rust-Cairo virtual machine.

StarkWare open-sourced its programming language compiler Cairo early in 2023, with the language aimed at driving the development of ZK-rollup and validity-proof-powered decentralized applications (DApps).

Ben-Sasson added that Starknet continues to chase an ambitious target of processing at least 10 times the throughput of Ethereum at a tenth of the cost. He highlighted StarkEx’s ability to deliver significant TPS on the decentralized exchange dYdX. StarkEx is another layer-2 scaling engine developed by StarkWare.

At times, dYdX processes up to 54 transactions per second, while the average TPS of Ethereum is around 10–12. Ben-Sasson also noted that these dYdX transactions are roughly four to five times larger than those on Ethereum, which bodes well for the improved scaling capabilities of Starknet in the near future:

“We’re often experiencing practical TPS or gas usage that is orders of magnitude greater than what Ethereum can deal with. I’m very confident that this will also be replicated on Starknet.”

Performance improvements have been prioritized as a result of developer and user feedback highlighting delays in transaction processing on Starknet. The next port of call is the reduction of transaction costs, which will be addressed by targeting the cost of storing data on Ethereum’s mainnet.

“We’re going to roll out Volition, which allows users to opt as to whether they want their data on or off-chain and this will be part of the base layer of the Starknet system.”

Ben-Sasson said the release of off-chain data availability will complement Ethereum’s in-development improvement proposal “Proto-Danksharding” Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will introduce a new type of transaction that carries binary large objects or “blobs.” The EIP fundamentally aims to provide cheaper transactions.

Starknet is also aiming to deliver faster finality further down the 2023 roadmap, which will produce shorter and fixed interval block times on the network. This will be carried out with the introduction of a fee market to prioritize Starknet’s network resources on users’ willingness to pay for transactions, inspired by conventional market systems:

“Market mechanisms are a very good way to solve this. Blockchain didn’t invent this — blockchains adopted this from just the conventional world. That’s how you prioritize resources and allow users to signal this.”

A number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols have begun rolling out ZK-rollups to further improve efforts to provide faster and cheaper transactions to the smart contract blockchain network. This includes the likes of Polygon and ConsenSys.

A Coinbase executive claims to have discovered a “jailbreak” for the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT that allows it to calculate the probability of bizarre crypto price scenarios.

The crypto exchange’s head of business operations Conor Grogan, an avid ChatGPT user, shared a screenshot of the results in an April 30 tweet — showing that ChatGPT states there be a 15% chance that Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

 will “fade to irrelevancy” with prices falling over 99.99% by 2035.

Meanwhile, the chatbot assigned a 20% chance of Ether

 becoming irrelevant and approaching near-zero price levels by 2035.

ChatGPT was even less confident about Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 and Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

, however, attributing probabilities of 35% and 45% respectively for the coins to go to near zero.

The Coinbase executive concluded that ChatGPT is “generally” a “big fan” of Bitcoin but remains “more skeptical” when it comes to altcoins.

— Conor (@jconorgrogan) April 30, 2023

Prior to the cryptocurrency predictions, Grogan asked ChatGPT to assign odds to several political predictions involving Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Other predictions were aimed towards the impact of AI on humanity, religion and the existence of aliens.

“Aliens have visited Earth and are being covered up by the government,” reads one wild prediction — to which ChatGPT assigned a 10% probability.

The executive also shared a script of the prompt, which he then fed to ChatGPT to build the tables.

Grogan backed up the preciseness of the results by claiming to have tested out the prompt over 100 times:

“I ran this prompt 100 times on a wiped memory GPT 3.5 and 4 and GPT would return very consistent numbers; standard deviation was

It isn’t the first time the executive experimented with crypto-related issues using ChatGPT.

On March 15, Grogan showed that GPT-4 — the latest iteration of ChatGPT — could spot security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts and provide an outline to exploit faulty contracts.

Studies carried out by OpenAI — the team behind ChatGPT — have shown GPT-4 to pass high school tests and law school exams with scores ranking in the 90th percentile.

Meanwhile, Italy recently lifted a ban on the AI tool after banning it for one month following a series of privacy concerns that were raised to Italian regulators.

Influence from friends and the fear of missing out (FOMO) were some of the reasons investors bought crypto for the first time in 2022, according to a survey by a United States financial regulator.

Published by the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Foundation in late April, the survey found that a large portion (31%) of new cryptocurrency investors cited “friend suggestion” as the primary reason for their foray into crypto. 

This is compared to only 8% for first-time equities or bond investors, potentially indicating that there is “a social element to cryptocurrency investing not evident in equities or bond investing,” according to FINRA.

However, the ability to “start with small amounts” was the second-biggest reason for making a move into the crypto market at 24%, similar to equities and bond investors.

Meanwhile, around 10% of respondents indicated a fear of missing out (FOMO) on a “potentially lucrative investment opportunity” led to them buying crypto for the first time, according to the survey.

The survey also found that 48% of crypto investors said they sourced information about the digital asset market from friends, family or work colleagues — compared to 35% for stock investors — followed by social media at 25%.

The survey also found that newer crypto investors were slighter younger on average (37 years old) and less college-educated (28.5% completed a four-year degree) compared to stock investors, who on average are 43 years old and 46.3% of whom have college degrees.

Interestingly, the study found that digital asset owners didn’t know as much about cryptocurrencies as they initially thought.

Digital asset investors scored 26.6% on a five-item quiz that asked questions about how a cryptocurrency is issued; transferred into U.S. dollars; how it is taxed; and how transactions may be “susceptible"" to fraud.

The 465 participants surveyed between Sept. 9 and Sept. 29 were randomly selected from U.S. households. The margin of error was 6.75%. The 2022 survey was part of a follow-up survey from 2020.

Risky assets marginally extend their up-move in April. The S&P 500 Index rose around 1.5% in April while Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,798

 is on track to end the month with gains of more than 4%. Could the rally continue in May or is it time for a pullback?

The recovery could face headwinds if the United States banking woes escalate further. JPMorgan Asset Management chief investment officer Bob Michele said in an interview with Bloomberg that the turmoil at First Republic Bank is unlikely to be limited to the bank only, and could cause a domino effect.

If that happens, then the U.S. equity markets may witness a correction. However, it is difficult to predict how Bitcoin will react to such a crisis because, in the past few days, BTC 65trose while legacy banking troubles deepened. But in case of a major upheaval in the U.S. banking sector, it is possible that Bitcoin will also face a correction sooner or later.

In the near term, Bitcoin and select altcoins are showing strength. Let’s study the charts of five cryptocurrencies that may outperform over the next few days.

Bitcoin price analysis

After two days of low volatile trading in Bitcoin, the bulls are trying to assert their supremacy on April 30.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day exponential moving average ($28,783) has started to turn up gradually, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If bulls kick Bitcoin’s price above $30,000, the BTC/USDT pair may climb to the overhead resistance zone of $31,000 to $32,400. Buyers may face formidable resistance at this zone, but if it is crossed, the pair can soar toward $40,000.

The 50-day simple moving average ($28,026) is the important support to keep an eye on. If BTC price collapses below this level, the bears will sense an opportunity and try to sink the pair to $25,250.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bears tried to yank the pair below the 20-EMA but the bulls held their ground. This may have attracted further buying and the bulls will next try to drive the price above $30,000. If they succeed, Bitcoin can rise to $30,500, or even $31,000.

Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bears are selling near overhead resistance levels. The pair may then slip to the 50-SMA.

The bulls will try to protect this level but if bears overpower them, the next stop is likely to be $27,000. Buyers are likely to defend the zone between $27,000 and $25,250 with all their might.

Solana price analysis

The bulls did not allow Solana 

SOL

$21

 to break back below the downtrend line during the most recent leg of the correction, indicating demand at lower levels.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers will next try to propel the price to the overhead resistance at $27.12. This remains the key resistance to watch for in the near term because if bulls catapult the price above it, the SOL/USDT pair may accelerate toward $39.

This bullish view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair could then plummet to the crucial support at $18.70. If the price rebounds off this level, it will signal that the pair may oscillate inside the large range between $18.70 and $27.12 for some time.

SOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages on the four-hour chart have started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that buyers are in control. The bears are trying to stall the recovery at $24 but if bulls overcome this barrier, the pair may pick up momentum and rally toward $25.50.

If the bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly tug the price back below the 20-EMA. The 50-SMA will be the support level to watch here if price begins to slide.

Cosmos price analysis

The long tail on Cosmos’ 

ATOM

$10.45

 April 26 candlestick shows that the bulls are fiercely defending the support at $10.20.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers have pushed the price above the moving averages and will try to reach the downtrend line. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break and close above it will open the doors for a potential rally to $13.50 and then to $15.50.

On the other hand, if the ATOM/USDT pair reverses direction from the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are trying to form a descending triangle pattern. A decline below the moving averages will open the doors for a possible retest of $10.20.

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has turned up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls are in control. There is a minor hurdle at $12.13, but that is likely to be crossed. ATOM price may then rise to test the downtrend line.

Instead, if the price turns down from $12.13, the bears will again try to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the buyers may be losing their grip. The pair then risks a slide to the 50-SMA.

Internet Computer price analysis

Internet Computer 

ICP

$5.35

 slipped below the 50-day SMA ($5.38) on April 26 but that proved to be a bear trap. The price turned up on April 27 and started a strong recovery.

ICP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($5.74) has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, indicating that bulls have a slight edge. If the price does not give up much ground from the current level or rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are buying the dips.

That will enhance the prospects of a rally to the downtrend line where the bears will again mount a strong defense. On the downside, a break below the 50-day SMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

ICP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the ICP/USDT pair is in a corrective phase. The first support is at the 20-EMA, which is close to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.14. If the price bounces off this support, the pair may rally to $7.23 and eventually to $7.70.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the short-term bulls may be booking profits. That could pull the price to the 50-SMA, which is near the 61.8% retracement level of $5.72.

Hedera price analysis

The bears repeatedly tried to sink Hedera 

HBAR

$0.05

 below $0.06 but the bulls held their ground. The failure to break the support attracted buyers who will try to push the price above the downtrend line.

HBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.06) is flattening out and the RSI has climbed above the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers thrust the price above the resistance line, the bullish momentum may pick up and the HBAR/USDT pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $0.08.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or the resistance line, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. That increases the possibility of a break below $0.06.

HBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the bulls flipped the moving averages into support and have launched an up-move that is likely to reach the resistance line. This level is expected to act as a strong resistance but on the way down, if the pair rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.

The pair may then break above the resistance line and start its journey to $0.07 and subsequently to $0.08. If the bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to quickly pull HBAR price below the moving averages.

YouTube’s swift intervention ensured damage control by preventing XRP hackers from interacting with the channel’s subscribers. Recently, one of the largest YouTube creators, Linus Tech Tips, also reported losing access to his channels.

While the exploit used by the hackers to gain access to YouTube accounts remains a mystery, the victim YouTubers have always been able to recover their accounts and deleted videos, if any.

The threat to crypto investors from such hacks is prominent, considering the rise of deepfakes, which are fake impersonation videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

Hackers often create deepfakes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other entrepreneurs to misguide crypto investors.

Yikes. Def not me.

Concerns escalated as Chinese tech giant Tencent launched a new deepfakes creation tool, allowing users to impersonate anyone for 1,000 yuan ($145).

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

The cryptocurrency market witnessed sharp volatility on April 26 on rumors that large sums of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 were on the move from the wallets linked to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and the United States government. A minor positive is that Bitcoin and select altcoins held their respective support levels.

After Bitcoin’s sharp rally in 2023, some traders seem to be planning to book profits. Coinglass reported that the Bitcoin balance held at Binance soared by 50,000 Bitcoin in the past 30 days.

While this could add to short-term pressure, bulls can take solace because the increase is not identical across exchanges. Coinglass said that the aggregate increase of Bitcoin balance across exchanges was 14,000 Bitcoin.

The next major event for the market is likely to be the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting on May 2 and 3. The FedWatch Tool projects a 90% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike at the meeting. Most analysts expect this to be the final rate hike before a pivot later in the year.

Could Bitcoin and select altcoins break above their respective resistance levels and resume the up-move? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin formed a long-legged doji candlestick pattern on April 26, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. This uncertainty resolved to the upside with a close above the 20-day exponential moving average ($28,619) on April 27.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA while the bulls will attempt to flip the level into support. If buyers succeed, the BTC/USDT pair will try to challenge the overhead resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,400. This zone is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment is turning negative and traders are selling on rallies. The pair may then retest the strong support at the 50-day simple moving average ($27,657). A break and close below this level could open the gates for a decline to $25,250.

ETH price analysis

The bulls kicked Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 above the 20-day EMA ($1,905) on April 26 and 27 but they could not reach the psychological level of $2,000. This suggests that the bears are trying to halt the recovery below $2,000.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This points to a possible range-bound action between $2,000 and $1,785 for a few days.

If that happens, it will be a positive sign because it will indicate that the bulls are not rushing to book profits. That will enhance the prospects for a potential rally to $2,200. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below $1,785. The ETH/USDT pair could then collapse to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,663.

BNB price analysis

The bulls propelled BNB 

BNB

$314

 above the $338 overhead resistance on April 26 but they could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls again tried to overcome the obstacle at $338 on April 27 but the bears did not budge. The selling picked up momentum on April 28 and the bears are trying to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($321). If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could dive to $300 and thereafter to $280.

Instead, if the price rebounds off the current level, it will indicate that bulls have not given up and are buying on dips. The bulls will have to surmount the hurdle at $350 to signal the start of a new uptrend toward $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 bounced off the support at $0.43 on April 26, indicating that the bulls are fiercely guarding this level.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.48), which is an important level for the bears to defend in the near term. If the price turns down from this level, the sellers will again try to yank the price below $0.43. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair may plunge to $0.36.

Contrarily, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair can reach the resistance line. A break and close above this level will suggest that the short-term corrective phase is over. The pair will then attempt a rally to $0.54 and subsequently to $0.58.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($0.38) on April 25 and 26, indicating that buyers are trying to start a recovery from this support.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ADA/USDT pair has reached the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern where the bears are trying to halt the recovery. If buyers overpower the sellers and sustain the price above the neckline, the pair should rally to $0.46.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the neckline, it will suggest that the bears are trying to prevent the reversal pattern from forming. The sellers will then make another attempt to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If they can pull it off, the pair could dump to $0.34.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bears pulled Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 below the support near $0.08 on April 26 but they failed to build upon the breakdown. Buyers purchased the dip and pushed the price back above the 50-day SMA ($0.08) on April 27.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The next resistance to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($0.08) and then the downtrend line. Buyers will have to propel the price above the downtrend line to clear the path for a possible rally to the $0.10 to $0.11 resistance zone.

Meanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price back below the support near $0.08. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair may slide to the vital support near $0.07. The bulls are likely to protect this level with all their might.

Polygon price analysis

The long tail on Polygon’s 

MATIC

$0.8801

 April 25 and 26 candlestick shows that the bulls are defending the support at $0.94 with vigor but the bears have not yet given up.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1.05) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. Sellers will try to halt the recovery in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line.

If the price turns down from the resistance line, it will signal the formation of a potential descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break below $0.94. If this support cracks, the MATIC/USDT pair risks a plunge to $0.69.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 tried to break out of the tight range trading on April 26 but failed. The bulls are again trying to resolve the uncertainty in their favor on April 28.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price rises above the immediate resistance at $23.18, it will signal that the bulls have absorbed the supply. The SOL/USDT pair will then attempt a rally toward the stiff overhead resistance at $27.12, which remains the key level for the bulls to overcome. If they do that, the pair can start a new up-move and soar to $39.

If bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly tug the price below the $18.70 support. That can sink the pair to the next support at $15.28.

Polkadot price analysis

The bears successfully defended the moving averages on April 26 but could not sustain the drop below the support at $5.70. This indicates that Polkadot 

DOT

$5.36

 is finding buyers at lower levels.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The DOT/USDT pair can swing between $5.70 and the 50-day SMA ($6.20) for some time. If the consolidation resolves to the downside, the selling could intensify and the pair may fall to $5.15. This level is likely to attract buyers.

Alternatively, if buyers drive the price above the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may first climb to $7 and if this resistance is scaled, the rally could stretch to $7.90.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 witnessed a hugely volatile day on April 26, indicating that the bulls and the bears tried to gain complete control but failed.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, large volatile days are followed by a range contraction for a few days. The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. The LTC/USDT pair may oscillate between $85 and $96 for some time.

A break above $96 or below $85 will start the next leg of the trending move. If bears sink the price below $85, the pair may plummet to $75. On the other hand, a rally above $96 may open the gates for a possible rally to $106.

Circle CEO warns of active and accelerating de-dollarization

The United States must capitalize on the “high demand” for digitally native U.S. dollars, particularly from those in emerging economies with weak local banking systems, the Circle CEO says.

The United States must implement stablecoin legislation and digitize the U.S. dollar to mitigate the “very active de-dollarization taking place” around the world right now, says Jeremy Allaire, the CE of stablecoin issuer Circle.

Allaire’s comments at the Consensus 2023 conference on April 26 were made in light of the recent U.S. banking crisis.

The CEO of Circle — the stablecoin issuer behind USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

 — called on Congress and the Federal Reserve to take action, saying that otherwise, alternative currencies and payment systems would continue to eat into the dollar’s dominance:

“We have a very active de-dollarization taking place. You’re having very significant reactions to the U.S. risks in the U.S. banking system, risks with the U.S. government itself, a geopolitical imposition on many parts of the world [and] the desire for alternative payment systems all around the world.""

“This is happening and it’s accelerating,” he added.

For the USD to remain “competitive” and “safe” in the internet era, Allaire said the U.S. needs to lay out stablecoin legislation imminently, and the Federal Reserve needs to implement the digital dollar into its “core systems” to capitalize on the high demand around the world:

“The demand for digital dollars like USDC is highly global. We see that demand all around the world — we see it in emerging markets, we see it in markets where people want to hold a digital dollar versus their local banking system [...] as an efficient medium of exchange for various types of international transactions.”

If we want to make the dollar safer and more competitive, we need to do two things:
- unleash it's power as a native data type on the internet, that can be openly used and integrated
- remove the underlying bank lending IOU risk on electronic money, and separate payment tokens… https://t.co/DThvu8Dt25

— Jeremy Allaire (@jerallaire) April 26, 2023

If the U.S. government doesn’t get its act together, this will be a “giant missed opportunity” for the country, Allaire stressed.

Related: US Bank collapse — Is crypto being targeted?

The call for action comes as the Chinese yuan overtook the dollar for cross-border transactions in China for the first time in March, according to Reuters.

Chinese Yuan overtakes US dollar as most-used currency in China's cross-border transactions for the first time in history.

Yuan-share rose to a record high of 48%, UP from nearly zero in 2010. 

U.S-share declined to 47%, DOWN from 83% over the same period.

Wow. pic.twitter.com/Lm3Rygpm45

— Genevieve Roch-Decter, CFA (@GRDecter) April 26, 2023

Circle has taken some responsibility into its own hands of late, having launched USDC on Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol.

Allaire said the new solution is the “most important new piece of blockchain infrastructure” since the firm began minting and issuing USDC in 2017.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has been at the forefront of the United States' cryptocurrency crackdown. In the last few months, the agency has filed several enforcement actions against major crypto companies that allegedly violated security laws.

Critics say the agency has adopted a regulation-by-enforcement approach without providing a proper set of rules that fit the unique features of crypto assets. A major source of confusion is the definition of a security and whether it can apply to a highly diverse set of assets such as cryptocurrencies. 

Despite being pressured in a congressional hearing last week, Gensler seems unwilling to take on the political responsibility of entering a constructive dialogue with the industry. 

For many crypto companies targeted by the SEC, the choice is between entering an expensive legal battle with the regulator or shutting down operations in the US and moving overseas. Most crypto companies will likely prefer saving millions of dollars in legal expenses and opt for the latter option.

The crypto community is calling out the alleged hypocrisy of Gary Gensler, the head of the United States securities regulator, after a 2018 video emerged of him stating that cryptocurrencies are on par with commodities or cash and are not securities.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

The video came from a “Blockchain and Money” class in the Fall Semester of 2018 taught by Gensler, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) before he became chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

On the topic of initial coin offerings (ICOs), Gensler said that “three-quarters of the market are not ICOs or not what would be called securities,” naming the U.S., Canadian and Taiwanese markets as the “three jurisdictions that follow something similar to the Howey test.”

""Three-quarters of the market is non-securities, it's just a commodity, cash,crypto,” Gensler then said.

The below clip is from a Fall 2018 Graduate MIT course called ""Blockchain and Money""

Gary Gensler - the current President of the SEC, was the professor.

The Hypocrisy speaks for itself

""So we already know in the US and in many other jurisdictions that 3/4 of the market… pic.twitter.com/rjRWeq5P8X

— zk- (@ZK_shark) April 25, 2023

While Gensler briefly acknowledged that ICOs may spark a securities debate, he concluded that “three-quarters of the market is not particularly relevant as a legal matter.”

Several members of the crypto community were stunned by Gensler’s remarks.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong commented a mere “Wow” in response to an April 26 Twitter post shared by cryptocurrency researcher “zk-SHARK.”

Wow https://t.co/gQZ7pRWacM

— Brian Armstrong ️ (@brian_armstrong) April 26, 2023

Erik Voorhees, the founder of crypto trading platform ShapeShift, asked, “When does someone get arrested for fraud?” in an April 25 tweet to his 658,900 followers.

When does someone get arrested for fraud? https://t.co/5BtU2sT5x2

— Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) April 25, 2023

Farokh Sarmad, the founder of Web3 podcast Rug Radio called Gensler “disgusting” in a tweet to his 346,200 followers, while a systems engineer, named “JD” called on the SEC Chair to provide an explanation behind the change in opinion.

Not everyone saw eye to eye though.

Related: Gary Gensler refuses to answer if ETH is a security: SEC hearing

U.S. lawyer Preston Byrne explained that professors and law enforcers work in “different capacities” and that Gensler shouldn’t be held to the same views he had back then.

I see a lot of people giving Gary Gensler a hard time over this but it’s important to note the different capacities in which he’s speaking. As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract. As a law enforcer, he’s required to enforce the laws as they’re written. https://t.co/mYhd7Hm8I9

— Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) April 26, 2023

Another U.S. lawyer, blockchain technology specialist Jonathan Schmalfeld, challenged Byrne’s opinion, stating that Gensler’s interpretation of the Howey test shouldn’t change by virtue of his capacity. The response prompted a second explanation from Byrne:

“I mean when I talk with clients about this stuff there are three answers, what I think the law is, how I think enforcers will interpret it, and what the law ought to be. Right now he’s limited to giving only one of those answers by virtue of his position.”

 users will soon be able to interact with the network through an open-source plugin enabled on OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT.

The plugin will allow ChatGPT to check wallet balances, transfer Solana-native tokens and purchase nonfungible tokens when OpenAI makes plugins available, according to an April 25 tweet by Solana Labs, the development firm behind the Solana blockchain.

Solana Labs is also encouraging developers to test using the open-source code to retrieve on-chain data that they may be interested in.

(1/2) Solana Labs has created an open-source reference implementation for a ChatGPT plugin that lets users interact with the @solana network directly from ChatGPT.

— Solana Labs (@solanalabs) April 25, 2023

The screenshot shared by Solana Labs shows that ChatGPT can retrieve a list of NFTs owned by a particular Solana address, which shares an attached metadata link to the NFT — presumably sourced from Solana Labs’ block explorer.

Solana Labs did not mention whether the plugin would be launched when OpenAI makes the plugin feature available to all.

The new ChatGPT plugins work by retrieving information from online sources and interacting with third-party websites to respond to commands requested by the user. The feature is currently being rolled out to all users.

However, not everyone is satisfied with the development.

One Twitter user asked Solana to firstly focus on developing a “working block explorer” while another questioned what benefit it would bring to the ecosystem.

It appears as though Solana Labs is now placing more focus on AI, having also announced on April 25 that it would provide $1 million in funding toward projects that build AI tools on Solana:

ChatGPT users can now delete chat history

On the same day, OpenAI announced ChatGPT users can now “turn off” their chat history, thanks to a new privacy feature.

The team announced the rollout of the new feature in an April 25 statement, which was launched to provide users with more control over their data. The firm added:

“Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar.”

The feature can be found in ChatGPT’s settings, which can be changed at any time, OpenAI said.

OpenAI explained that deleted conversations will be retained for 30 days for the purposes of reviewing them to monitor abusive material. Once that is cleared, conversations will be permanently deleted.

The AI firm also added in a new “export” option for users to download their data and make more sense of what information ChatGPT stores.

The new privacy feature comes as Italy recently became the first European country to ban ChatGPT until it complies with the European Union’s user privacy laws pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Unlike restricted proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, the Polkadot blockchain allows cross-blockchain transfers of any asset or data, facilitates more transactions per second and needs less infrastructure.

Polkadot uses a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) blockchain centered on interoperability of parachains that connect to and are secured by the Relay Chain. Validators can validate both the Relay Chain and the parachains, making it a flexible and scalable blockchain solution.

The native token on the Polkadot blockchain is named DOT 

DOT

$5.36

. It can be used on the Polkadot network for trading, staking, bonding, paying transaction fees and voting in network governance.

This article highlights what Polkadot staking is, how it works, how to stake DOT, its requirements and rewards, and why tokenholders should stake DOT.

What is Polkadot staking and how it works

Founded in 2016 as a layer-0 protocol and multichain network, Polkadot is a blockchain project introduced by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.

The project aims to create a decentralized, secure and fair internet known as Web 3.0, or Web3, by facilitating communication across previously incompatible and independent blockchain networks.

Polkadot staking involves using DOT tokens to nominate validators in exchange for earning rewards. Polkadot is an NPoS blockchain that relies on nodes to verify transactions and secure its network. The NPoS mechanism is a sophisticated process in which nominators select the validators who are allowed to participate in its consensus protocol. Generally, more participants and more distributed nodes mean a more decentralized network, reducing the likelihood of successful blockchain attacks by hackers.

Depending on their availability, level of expertise and budget, DOT holders can engage with the Polkadot staking system natively in four main ways. Stakers unable to produce the minimum required amount to nominate individually (this is a fluctuating amount) can join a nomination pool and share all benefits and penalties proportionally.

Alternatively, stakers can nominate validators. Stakers often choose a validator based on their reliability in verifying the legitimacy of network transactions. On the other hand, stakers can open and run a nomination pool, if they are confident in their abilities to identify competent and trustworthy validators, and ask for a commission. Others can join and stake their cryptocurrency.

At the top end are the validators, better suited to people with significant time commitment and technical expertise. These people run the nodes, which are servers running specialized software that may submit a block of transactions and either validate or disapprove it.

Note that there’s a stringent set of staking requirements before Polkadot allows anyone to become a validator since validators need specialized expertise and validators will be in charge of a master node.

Stakers who stake with a validator get more Polkadot tokens as a reward if the validator correctly verifies a transaction. If validators approve a fraudulent transaction or try to defraud the system, they and their nominators will get slashed by losing a percentage of their staked DOT. Any slashed DOT will be added to the Polkadot Treasury.

Additionally, there are specialized positions that require more technical expertise than a nominator but less commitment than a validator. These include collators, who are responsible for keeping track of valid parachain transactions and submitting them to validators on the Relay Chain, and members of the Polkadot Alliance.

DOT staking requirements

Users will need a fluctuating minimum amount of DOT to stake and nominate directly. This rule does not apply when joining a nomination pool, using a liquid staking method or using an exchange since users delegate their power to validators who meet minimum requirements.

An exchange platform may impose additional requirements, such as Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering, minimum staking amounts, minimum lockup periods or fees.

Why stake Polkadot

Staking DOT is a way to provide security and decentralization to the network and earn staking rewards. People who stake DOT help maintain the network’s stability, development and security in exchange for DOT.

Stakers can even use the staked tokens to generate a passive revenue stream with the potential for growth in the ecosystem. Stakers in the Polkadot ecosystem get to participate in the network’s governance while benefiting from the token’s appreciation.

How to stake Polkadot (DOT)?

DOT holders may participate in the network’s governance by staking their tokens and earning DOT token rewards.

The common ways to stake DOT are through a cryptocurrency exchange, a hardware wallet, the network’s Polkadot.js user interface (UI) or the Polkadot app.

1. Using Polkadot.js UI

Stakers may use the Polkadot.js UI to either stake as a validator or a nominator. Nominators can propose up to 16 validator prospects on the Polkadot platform. The Polkadot network relies on validators to operate nodes and ensure the network’s safety and reliability.

There are rewards for the validators and nominators, and the validators’ behavior determines the amount of rewards the nominators will receive. In short, the higher the performance of the validator, the higher the rewards for validators and nominators.

Here are the steps to nominate a validator on the Polkadot.js UI or the Polkadot app:

Create a Polkadot account.
Navigate and select the “Network > Staking > Accounts page” tab.
Click “+ Nominator.”
Choose a stash and controller account.
Enter the amount to bond.
Choose a desired validator.
2. Stake natively or join a nomination pool

Native staking is one of the easiest ways to stake DOT, and users have the option to stake directly as a nominator or join a nomination pool. The Polkadot website has a dedicated page explaining this process in detail.

3. Using a cryptocurrency exchange

This method has gained popularity since it is relatively easy to stake in a staking pool on a cryptocurrency exchange. It involves users purchasing DOT tokens on their chosen exchange, adding them to their Polkadot wallet and then clicking the stake button to begin staking.

Stakers can acquire DOT tokens using fiat or crypto. After that, they deposit the tokens into the exchange account or directly to the Polkadot wallet if they already hold one. When deposited into the Polkadot platform, DOT tokens have the potential to earn substantial rewards with minimal effort from stakers.

Examples of staking platforms include Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin and Crypto.com.

Staking with an exchange can be a convenient option, but it comes with its own set of challenges:

Lack of control over private keys: When staking with an exchange, users are not in control of their private keys. This means that they have to rely on the exchange’s practices and security measures.
Reduced staking rewards: Exchanges usually take a percentage of the staking rewards as a fee for their services. This means that users will earn less than they would if they were staking independently.
Increased risk of hacks and exploits: As more people stake with a particular exchange, the exchange’s wallet grows, giving it more voting power and potentially centralizing the blockchain network. This also makes it a more attractive target for hackers and other bad actors who may try to exploit vulnerabilities in the exchange’s security.
4. Using a wallet

Staking DOT through a wallet is more complicated than staking on a cryptocurrency exchange. When using a wallet, the chosen validator is the only intermediary between a staker and the rewards.

Users must first choose up to 16 validators before they can begin staking. Therefore, stakers should carefully evaluate their validators before committing to the wallet method. Also, they should be mindful of the provider’s security, dependability and track record before selecting a validator or staking service.

To start staking using a wallet, a staker must first get some DOT from an exchange and deposit it into a DOT wallet. There are several wallets available to stake DOT, with options including:

Ledger
Polkadot.js
Talisman
Fearless
Subwallet
Nova
Polkawallet

Users should choose their wallet based on how much DOT they want to stake and the purpose for which they intend to use their DOT wallet.

Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are the safest alternative, since they store and back up private keys offline. However, there is often a more complex learning curve and higher costs associated with hardware wallets. Ledger is the only DOT-compatible hardware wallet.

Alternatively, users may choose a software wallet, which is convenient and free. Although easy to use, software wallets aren’t as safe as hardware wallets. Thus, they are probably better for storing fewer DOT or for inexperienced users.

DOT staking rewards

Once every 24 hours, delegators and stakers get Polkadot staking rewards depending on how many blocks their stake contributed to creating. Compared to other proof-of-stake blockchains and exchange staking, Polkadot is likely to provide higher returns.

According to crypto-staking data aggregator Staking Rewards, the annual reward rate Polkadot holders may receive varies based on the wallet, the crypto-trading platform and the validators. The maximum annual reward rate that holders can earn is 14.34%. Polkadot’s staking dashboard provides on-chain data to indicate current rewards.

Similarly, staking DOT tokens can give different rewards based on the type of staking method. Nominators who do not run the nodes themselves but instead assign the stakes to validators may earn a maximum annual reward rate of 14.1%. Due to the added responsibility of maintaining the network, validator node operators might make as much as 14.8%.

What are the risks of staking Polkadot?

Like any other investment, staking in Polkadot has its own set of risks. Although it currently offers a healthy annual reward rate, that can change due to prevailing market conditions. Most staking platforms review their interest rewards periodically.

Although the Polkadot staking system design is highly secure, there are a few risks associated with nominating the validators. For instance, if validators breach the terms and conditions, Polkadot may punish (slash) their stake, which means stakers may lose some of their staked DOT.

Because of slashing, nominators must be extremely vigilant in their selection of validators. They should only settle on validators with a proven track record of reliability. Also, DOT has an unbonding period of 28 days, which means stakers must wait at least 28 days before receiving their tokens. That can be a disadvantage in a highly volatile market.

If a chosen validator is unresponsive during an entire session, the validator’s bond will undergo involuntary chilling and may not be up for selection in the next session. Moreover, the validator will not earn rewards during the chilling session.

When users stake DOT on a software wallet, its safety is only as good as the wallet provider’s safety protocols. That is beyond the safety reach of Polkadot and is vulnerable to hacking beyond its control.

A freshly unsealed indictment has charged five individuals with “conspiring to manipulate the market” in relation to an alleged scheme involving the ERC-20 Hydro (HYDRO) token.

An April 24 statement from the United States Department of Justice said that the indictment charged three people for conspiring to manipulate the market for Hydro. Two other individuals were separately charged for their alleged roles in the scheme.

The DOJ alleges that from June 2018 through April 2019, Michael Ross Kane, the former CEO of Hydrogen Technology Corp.; Shane Hampton, Hydrogen’s chief of financial engineering; and George Wolvaardt defrauded market participants looking to trade the Hydro tokens thaHydrogen issued.

Five Individuals Charged in $2M Virtual Asset and Securities Manipulation Schemehttps://t.co/qLrHjkTKlY

— Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) April 24, 2023

According to the indictment, Wolvaardt, who was the chief technology officer for a market-making firm called Moonwalkers Trading Limited, designed a trading bot that executed a number of high-value “spoof orders” at obscure intervals to make it appear as though there was high demand for the token. The bot also bought and sold large volumes of the token from the same account — a practice known as wash trading.

Following the alleged artificial manipulation of the price of Hydro, the DOJ claims the co-conspirators sold large chunks of their holdings netting an approximate total of $2 million in ill-gotten profits.

In addition, Tyler Ostern, the former CEO of Moonwalkers, and Andrew Chorlian, a blockchain engineer from Hydrogen Technology Corp. were also charged for their involvement in the alleged manipulation scheme.

Kane, Hampton and Wolvaardt have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities price manipulation, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud.

If found guilty on all charges, they each face a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment in relation to the conspiracy to commit securities price manipulation charge and a staggering 20 years in prison on each of the other charges.

Ostern and Chorlian have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities price manipulation and wire fraud. If found guilty, they face a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

On April 20, a New York District Court judge ruled against Hydrogen Technology Corporation and former Hydrogen CEO Michael Ross Kane, in a suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, ordering them to pay $2.8 million in remedies and civil penalties.

Cointelegraph contacted Michael Kane for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Chainlink’s 

LINK

$6.54

 low-latency oracles will integrate with the decentralized exchange (DEX) GMX following a successful governance proposal that sought to provide more “granular” real-time market data to GMX v2.

Voting ended on April 25 at 12:00 am UTC, with over 96% of participating GMX tokenholders voting in favor of the proposal.

The new Chainlink oracles — which were built with the input of GMX core contributors — were brought in to improve upon the functionality of perpetual DEXs and price-sensitive trading on GMX, the author of the proposal explained.

The @GMX_IO community has officially approved a proposal to integrate Chainlink's new low-latency oracles as the launch partner in an on-chain vote with 96.28% approval.

This integration will enhance both the security and UX of GMX's derivatives protocol.https://t.co/sh1tLDLtps

— Chainlink (@chainlink) April 25, 2023

In addition, the low-latency oracles are said to strengthen security, further decentralize the protocol and improve upon the user experience, Johann Eid, the head of integration at Chainlink Labs, said.

While these new oracles utilize the same oracle node operators and data aggregation mechanisms used in existing Chainlink reference feeds, Eid explained that the new oracles extract data at a “higher frequency.”

“The new Chainlink low-latency oracles will utilize the same set of oracle node operators and multi-layered data aggregation mechanism currently deployed in existing Chainlink reference feeds, but operate via a pull-based mechanism to meet the speed requirements of DeFi derivatives.”

Eid explained the strengthened security will come from the low-latency oracles providing a “strong degree of tamper-resistance when settling user trades.”

Another Twitter commentator, Aylo, explained to their 62,600 followers on April 8 that the integration would “reduce exposure to stale price execution and value extraction” for GMX derivative traders.

So how does this help GMX?

In a nutshell:

This solution helps GMX reduce trading fees and increase efficiency and user experience.

— Aylo (@alpha_pls) April 8, 2023

A beta version of the GMX-tailored, low-latency oracle feeds — which have been in the works since 2022 — are now available on the Arbitrum testnet.

In return for the service, Chainlink will receive 1.2% of protocol fees generated by the low-latency oracles from the GMX protocol.

Protocol fees include the fees paid by users from margin trading in addition to standard borrow fees and swap fees.

Eid stated that Chainlink would continue to refine its oracle services to GMX as the protocol continues to “expand” and “evolve.”

It appears as though GMX isn’t the first perpetual DEX to get on board with the new type of oracle though.

Matt Losquadro, a former ambassador of on-chain derivatives platform Synthetix, said it integrated a similar solution first, which was observed by a member of the GMX community prior to the proposal being put forward:

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 managed to stay above $27,000 for the past three days, but its 9% loss last week spooked some newbie traders. Glassnode data shows that short-term holders who acquired Bitcoin less than 155 days ago have been moving coins to the exchanges at a loss since April 16. 

While short-term traders are panicking and focusing on the $25,000 level on the downside, some analysts are turning bullish for the next year. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jamie Douglas Coutts expects Bitcoin to reach $50,000 by April 2024.

Another bullish voice was that of Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick who said that the “crypto winter” may be over. He projected that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $100,000 by end-2024.

What are the important support levels where the latest leg of the correction may attract buyers? Let’s study the charts of Bitcoin and altcoins to find out.

S&P 500 index price analysis

The S&P 500 index (SPX) has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average (4,098), indicating that the bears are selling the rallies near 4,200.

SPX daily chart. Source: TradingView

A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-day EMA. That improves the prospects of a break above 4,200. If that happens, the index may rally to 4,300. This level may witness aggressive selling by the bears.

The first level of support on the downside is the 20-day EMA. If it cracks, the index may slip to the 50-day simple moving average (4,034) and, thereafter, to the uptrend line of the ascending triangle pattern.

U.S. dollar index price analysis

The failure of the bulls to push the U.S. dollar index (DXY) above the 20-day EMA (102) in the past few days seems to have emboldened the bears who are trying to gain control.

DXY daily chart. Source: TradingView

The index could retest 100.82 which is an important level to keep an eye on. If this support breaks down, the index will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern. This setup may start the next leg of the downtrend toward 97.50.

On the contrary, if the price once again rebounds off 100.82, it will suggest that the bulls are protecting this level with all their might. A break and close above the 20-day EMA will suggest that the index may oscillate between 100.82 and 106 for some time.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin is stuck between the moving averages for the past few days, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The bulls are buying the dips to the 50-day SMA ($27,078) while the bears are protecting the 20-day EMA ($28,466).

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

This uncertainty is unlikely to continue for long. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate advantage to the bears. This increases the likelihood of a break below the 50-day SMA.

The BTC/USDT pair may then plunge to the important support at $25,250. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might.

On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The index may then attempt a rally to $31,000.

Ether price analysis

The bulls successfully held Ether’s pullback at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,846, but they failed to clear the overhead hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($1,913).

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to strengthen their position further by pulling the price below the 50-day SMA ($1,799). If they do that, the ETH/USDT pair could extend its decline to the 61.8% retracement level of $1,663.

Contrarily, a strong rebound off the 50-day SMA or the 50% retracement level of $1,754 will suggest solid buying at lower levels. A break and close above the 20-day EMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls. The pair may then rise to $2,000 and later to $2,200.

BNB price analysis

The bulls are trying to push BNB 

BNB

$314

 above the overhead resistance at $338 but the bears are holding their ground.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls fail to clear the overhead hurdle, the bears will again attempt to sink the BNB/USDT pair below the 50-day SMA ($316). If they manage to do that, the pair may drop to $300. This level may act as a minor support, but if it also cracks, the next stop could be $280.

On the upside, the bulls will have to thrust the price above the $338-to-$346 resistance zone to seize control. There is a minor resistance at $360, but that is likely to be crossed. The pair could then soar to $400.

XRP price analysis

The bulls defended the 50-day SMA ($0.45) on April 22 and tried to thrust XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 above the 20-day EMA ($0.48) on April 24, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the bears are active at higher levels.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the 50-day SMA gives way, the XRP/USDT pair could plummet to $0.43. This is an important level to watch for because, if it cracks, the pair may extend its decline to $0.36.

If bulls want to prevent a decline, they will have to quickly propel the price back above the 20-day EMA. The pair could then rise to the resistance line where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If this barrier is overcome, the pair may rally to $0.56.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days. This suggests uncertainty regarding the next directional move.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.40) has started to turn down and the RSI is near 45, indicating that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. If the 50-day SMA ($0.37) support crumbles, the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then to $0.30.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The pair will then again try to rally above the neckline and retest the resistance near $0.46.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8801

 remains in a firm bear grip in the near term as every attempt to rally is being met with selling by the bears.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The MATIC/USDT pair could next fall to $0.94 which is likely to act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, the buyers will make one more attempt to push the pair above the moving averages.

If they are successful, the pair may reach the resistance line. Buyers will have to kick the price above this level to start a potential recovery to $1.30.

Another possibility is that the price plunges below the $0.94 support. In that case, the pair will clear the path for a likely fall toward $0.69.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bulls are trying to defend the support near $0.08 but the shallow bounce in Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 shows that demand dries up at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.08) has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears have a slight edge. If the price crumbles below the $0.08 support, the DOGE/USDT pair may decline further to the next major support at $0.07.

This negative view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA. The pair may then rise to $0.10 and, subsequently, to $0.11. The bears are likely to guard this level with vigor.

Solana price analysis

The bulls are trying to protect the 50-day SMA ($21.26) but the bears have kept up the pressure and have not allowed Solana 

SOL

$21

 to sustain above the 20-day EMA ($22.30).

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the 50-day SMA support collapses, the SOL/USDT pair could dump to $18.70. The bulls will try to defend this level but if they fail, the pair may continue its downward move toward the vital support at $15.28.

Conversely, if the price turns up and rallies above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip the downtrend line into support. The pair may then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $27.12.

In partnership with the blockchain mobile application Socios.com, the OG esports club powered by the Chiliz (CHZ) token aims to enhance the sporting experience. OG’s rally this week was followed by an interest spike in fan tokens like Manchester City Fan Token (CITY) and FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR).

The token was trading at $2.90 when its VORTECS™ Score — a historical “snapshot” comparison between current and past market conditions for individual coins — rose above 75. Over the next 24 hours, OG’s price skyrocketed to $13.90. That’s a remarkable jump of 379%!

Five days later, traders could have captured additional gains as OG took off again. On April 13, a VORTECS™ Score of 80 lit up. Over the next 24 hours, the token saw a rapid rise of 40%.

Anyone with access to Markets Pro had a chance to capture these gains, which stand in stark contrast to Ether’s 

ETH

$1,855

 performance so far in April. Ethereum had the historic “Shanghai Capella” upgrade, allowing token withdrawals to be made from the deposit contract.

The upgrade effectively unlocked $36.4 billion in staked ETH and drove the coin’s price from $1,775 at the start of April to as high as $2,132 — a lackluster gain of just over 20%.

Cointelegraph Markets Pro, on the other hand, delivered multiple alerts that led to significant gains in the underlying tokens associated with those alerts. A summary of these results is provided in the weekly VORTECS™ Report. Since March 26, a number of winning trade opportunities have stood out.

VORTECS™ Alerts
Rocket Pool (RPL) — 45% gain

RPL was one of many high VORTECS™ assets this week! On April 13, a strong score of 80 was flashing when the asset was trading at $42.18. The price soon began a sharp ascent, peaking at $60.97 on April 17! That’s an increase of 45%!

A green score of 75 also briefly flashed on April 15 when RPL was trading at $52.53. Traders who bought this price point could’ve seen a 16% gain in just two days!

RPL is the utility and governance token of Rocket Pool, a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. The project is the first Ethereum staking pool that is fully decentralized.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 is on target to finish the week with a sharp fall of around 9%. This suggests that some traders may be booking profits in fear of a resumption of the downtrend. Analysts expect Bitcoin to reach the $26,600–$25,000 zone, where buying interest may pick up.

When an asset emerges from a bear market, it tries to form higher lows on the way up. These levels act as strong supports during subsequent corrections. The current pullback could end up forming a higher floor for Bitcoin, which may act as a launch pad for the next rally.

If long-term investors believe that a bottom has been made, then panicking and selling on every corrective phase is not a good strategy. Rather, every dip could be an opportunity to build a portfolio.

The correction in Bitcoin has pulled several altcoins lower. Only a handful of major cryptocurrencies are holding out and looking strong on the charts. Let’s study the charts of five cryptocurrencies that may outperform on the way up.

Bitcoin price analysis

Buyers are trying to arrest Bitcoin’s correction at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($26,983), but the shallow bounce suggests that the bears are not willing to give up.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,606) has started to turn down, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative zone, signaling that bears have a slight edge. The selling could pick up further if the 50-day SMA cracks.

The BTC/USDT pair could then tumble to the breakout level of $25,250. This is an important level to keep an eye on because if this support crumbles, the pair may plunge to $20,000.

Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to signal a comeback. That could attract buying and push the price toward the $31,000–$32,500 resistance zone.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The pair bounced off $27,125 and reached the 20-day EMA. This is the first hurdle that the bulls need to cross to start a strong recovery. The pair may then reach the 50-day SMA, where the bears will again try to mount a strong defense.

If the price turns down from the current level and slides below $27,125, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. That will increase the likelihood of a fall to $26,500 and eventually to $25,250.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. Sellers are active above $338, while the bulls are fiercely defending the 50-day SMA ($316).

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The BNB/USDT pair rebounded off the 50-day SMA on April 21, and the bulls are attempting to clear the hurdle at $338. If they succeed, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $346. The pair may then soar toward $400. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($325) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have a slight edge.

If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to yank the price back below the 50-day SMA. That could accelerate selling and sink the pair to $300 and thereafter toward $280.

BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the price rebounded off the support near $316 and has reached the 50-SMA. If bulls overcome this obstacle, the pair will try to rise to $338 and subsequently to $346. A break above this level could witness a pick-up in bullish momentum.

The first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. If this support gives way, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $315 and $335 for some time. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the $315 support gives way.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano’s ADA 

ADA

$0.366

 turned down and plunged back below the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern on April 20. This indicates that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they are trying to guard the 50-day SMA ($0.37).

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.40) has turned down, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating that sellers are trying to seize control. If the price plummets below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in the driver’s seat. The ADA/USDT pair could then collapse to $0.30.

Conversely, if buyers want to retain their supremacy, they will have to quickly thrust the price back above the neckline. If they manage to do that, the pair could witness solid buying. The pair may then surge to $0.46.

ADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the bears pulled the price below the uptrend line and are trying to flip the level into resistance on a retest. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the price slips below $0.38, the selling could intensify, and the pair may plunge to $0.34.

This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers propel the price back above the uptrend line. Such a move will suggest that the recent breakdown may have been a bear trap. The recovery is likely to pick up momentum after buyers push the price above the 50-SMA.

Monero price analysis

Monero 

XMR

$156

 turned down from the neckline of the developing inverse H&S pattern, but the sharp recovery from lower levels indicates aggressive buying on dips.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers have pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA ($157) and will again try to challenge the neckline. If this level is scaled, it will complete the bullish setup, clearing the path for a potential rise to $185 and thereafter to the pattern target of $199.

If the price turns down from the current level or the neckline, it will signal that bears are selling on rallies. A break and close below $149 will signal that bears have seized control. The XMR/USDT pair may then slump to $145 and later to $140.

XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The pair is trading inside a descending channel pattern on the four-hour chart. The snapback from the support line of the channel shows solid buying at lower levels. If buyers sustain the price above the 50-SMA, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the channel.

Contrarily, if the price continues lower and slides below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the pair may remain stuck inside the channel for some more time. The bears will gain the upper hand on a break below the channel.

Toncoin price analysis

Toncoin (TON) has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, but a positive sign in favor of the buyers is that the price has been trading near the resistance line of the triangle for the past few days.

TON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will try to drive and sustain the price above the resistance line, which will invalidate the bearish setup. A breakdown of a negative pattern usually results in an up-move because aggressive traders who may have gone short in anticipation of a decline cover their positions.

Additionally, bullish traders who have been sitting on the sidelines due to the negative setup jump in to buy. Above the resistance line, the TON/USDT pair could rally to $2.64 and thereafter to $2.90.

This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below $2.20.

TON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the pair is rising inside an ascending channel pattern. In the near term, the bears are trying to protect the $2.33 level, but the bulls continue to attack the level with vigor.

If the $2.33 level gives way, the pair may start its journey toward the resistance line of the channel near $2.45. Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from $2.33, the bears will try to sink the pair to the support line of the channel.

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 suffered a big blow on April 20, popularly known as “Dogeday,” thanks to the failed test launch of SpaceX’s Starship rocket and a downturn in the broader crypto market. 

The SpaceX rocket, which featured the Dogecoin mascot on its side, disintegrated four minutes after its launch. Still, the company’s employees, including Elon Musk, cheered the failure as they expressed optimism for another test in the coming months.

The move comes on the heels of Musk’s recent stunt wherein he momentarily changed Twitter’s logo to the Dogecoin mascot.

The launch had built considerable excitement within the Dogecoin community. DogeDesigner, a graphic designer in the Dogecoin community, tweeted about the rocket launch with eagerness.

The launch of the biggest rocket of the planet, delayed for the sake of memes.

However, Dogeday appears to have turned into a sell-the-news event, with the DOGE/USD pair losing 11.88% of the day’s high of $0.093 to drop to $0.083.

DOGE open interest remains elevated

Despite the drop in prices, the open interest (OI) volume for Dogecoin futures contracts is above the January 2023 high at $470 million, according to Coinglass data. OI volume represents the number of open positions in the futures market.

Dogecoin’s OI volume spiked to a yearly peak of $580 million on April 4 after Twitter changed its logo to a Shiba Inu, the breed of dog used to represent Dogecoin.

The DOGE/USD pair exhibited significant volatility following the logo change, rising over 21% to a new yearly peak of $0.10 on April 4. However, the price and IO volumes declined significantly after the social media platform returned to its original blue bird logo. The logo change was only active between April 4 to April 7.

A report from crypto analytics firm Kaiko noted:

“DOGE open interest has roughly doubled since Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, suggesting robust capital inflows.”

The OI volume for futures contracts dropped to $460 million following a wave of liquidations. However, the OI volumes picked up again to $533 million, leading up to the excitement around the rocket launch.

While the DOGE price dip caused widespread liquidations of around $104 million, the OI volumes are above the January 2023 highs, suggesting that the coin may experience more volatility.

The long-to-short ratio of the futures market shows a greater inclination toward short orders, acting as a contrarian signal for further upside.

At the same time, the funding rate for perpetual swap contracts has turned positive since the dip, raising the possibility of more downturn from a long squeeze.

DOGE price analysis

The supply distribution of DOGE whale addresses registered a spike, with addresses holding more than $10 million in DOGE accumulating quickly. However, these whales sold their DOGE immediately after Twitter changed its logo back.

These addresses repeated the same accumulation and distribution around Dogeday, selling heavily into the Dogeday decline.

The DOGE/USD pair has broken below the bullish parallel trend, raising concerns about further downside risk.

Based on the size of the parallel channel, the DOGE/USD projects a 15% decline from the present $0.083 level. A drop below of this magnitude will coincide with a DOGE support level of around $0.072.

The failed launch of SpaceX’s Starship rocket on Dogeday, coupled with the downturn in Bitcoin’s price, dealt a blow to DOGE price.

Despite this setback, the open interest volume for Dogecoin futures contracts remains elevated, indicating robust capital inflows. However, the recent dip in prices and increased selling by DOGE whales suggest further downside risks, with the DOGE/USD pair breaking below its bullish support.

BTC

$27,796

 and most major cryptocurrencies have pulled back from their recent local highs, signaling profit-booking by traders. Is the current pullback a buying opportunity, or has the trend turned lower? This is likely to be the question in every trader’s mind.

Bollinger Bands creator John Bollinger said in a recent tweet that Bitcoin had turned down from the upper Bollinger Band and reached the middle bank, near its breakout level. He said it was a “logical place” and advised traders to “pay attention.”

The correction could worry short-term crypto traders, but for long-term investors who believe that a bottom is in, this could prove to be an opportunity to build their portfolio with cryptocurrencies of their choice. It is generally a good strategy to avoid buying on the way down and wait for the price to stop falling before resuming purchases.

What are the levels that may act as strong support? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin fell and closed below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,869) on April 19. This was the first close below the 20-day EMA since March 13, indicating weakness.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers tried to stage a recovery on April 20, but they could not overcome the barrier at the 20-day EMA. This suggests that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. The BTC/USDT pair may next slip to $26,500 and thereafter to the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern at $25,250.

If the price rebounds off $25,250, it will indicate that the neckline is acting as a higher floor. The bulls will then try to propel the price back above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair may rise to $32,400.

Ether price analysis

The bulls tried to maintain the price of Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 above the 20-day EMA ($1,942) on April 19 and 20, but the bears had other plans. They maintained their selling pressure and yanked ETH below the 20-day EMA on April 21.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $1,846. This level is likely to attract strong buying by the bulls. If the price turns up from this level, it improves the prospects for a rally to $2,200.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below $1,846, the ETH/USDT pair could tumble to the 50% retracement level of $1,755 and thereafter to the 61.8% retracement level of 1,663.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 rebounded off the $318 support on April 21 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($324). This suggests that the bulls are making a strong effort to arrest the decline at $318.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint do not give a clear edge either to the bulls or the bears. If bulls thrust the price above the $338–$350 resistance zone, the BNB/USDT pair may pick up momentum and soar toward $400.

On the contrary, if the price once again turns down and breaks below $318, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then slump to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) ($295), which is an important level for the bulls to defend.

XRP price analysis

The bulls tried to start a recovery in XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.49) on April 19 and 20, but the bears were in no mood to relent.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls tried to arrest the fall near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.47, but the bears maintained the selling pressure and pulled the price below it. The XRP/USDT pair may next drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.41).

It looks like the pair may trade inside a large range between $0.56 and $0.30 for a while longer. If the price rebounds off the 200-day SMA, the pair may trade in the upper half of the range while a break below it may keep the pair stuck in the lower half.

Cardano price analysis

The bears succeeded in pulling Cardano‘s ADA 

ADA

$0.366

 back below the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern on April 20. This suggests that the bears are making a comeback.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bears pin the price below the neckline, it will signal that the breakout on April 13 may have been a bull trap. That could lead to long liquidation, which may extend the decline to the 200-day SMA ($0.35). This level is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.

The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.40) and the RSI near the center do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If bulls want to come out on top, they will have to kick and sustain the price above the neckline. The ADA/USDT pair may then rise to $0.46.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 witnessed hugely volatile moves on April 19 and 20. The bulls are trying to hold the 200-day SMA ($0.08) but are facing stiff resistance from the bears.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.09), it will suggest that the bears are selling on every minor rally. That will increase the risk of a collapse below the 200-day SMA. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair may dive to the crucial support at $0.07.

This negative view will be invalidated if the price turns up from the current level and soars above $0.10. That will indicate solid buying near the 200-day SMA. The pair may then reach $0.11, where the bulls may again face formidable resistance from the bears.

Polygon price analysis

The uncertainty of the symmetrical triangle pattern in Polygon‘s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8801

 resolved to the downside with a break below the support line on April 19.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are trying to protect the 200-day SMA ($1.01), but any recovery is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.11). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will increase the possibility of a break below the 200-day SMA. That could intensify selling and sink the MATIC/USDT pair toward the pattern target of $0.74.

Contrary to this assumption, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. The pair may then rise to the resistance line of the triangle. A break and close above this level may turn the table in favor of the bulls.

Solana price analysis

Solana‘s SOL 

SOL

$21

 has been stuck between the 20-day EMA ($22.61) and the 200-day SMA ($20.91) for the past two days.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Although the bears have yanked the price below the 20-day EMA, they have not yet been able to retest the 200-day SMA. This suggests a lack of aggressive selling at lower levels.

The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term.

The SOL/USDT pair may swing inside the large range between $27.12 and $15.28 for some time. If the price slips below the 200-day SMA, the pair may drop to $18.70; but if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, the pair may surge to $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Polkadot}s DOT 

DOT

$5.36

 turned down sharply and plunged below the uptrend line on April 19. This indicates aggressive selling by the bears.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls tried to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on April 20, but the long wick on the candlestick shows the bears protected the level successfully. That started a downward move toward the 200-day SMA ($5.93).

Buyers are expected to fiercely guard the zone between the 200-day SMA and $5.70 because if they fail to do that, the selling may intensify further and the DOT/USDT pair could dive to $5.15. This bearish view will invalidate in the near term if bulls push and sustain the price back above the uptrend line.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 plunged below the 20-day EMA ($93) on April 19, indicating that the bullish momentum has weakened.

Buyers tried to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on April 20, but the bears did not relent. This suggests that the bears are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into resistance.

The sellers will next try to strengthen their position further by sinking the price below the strong support at $85. If they manage to do that, the LTC/USDT pair may reach the 200-day SMA ($78).

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly drive the price above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance of $96.

The Polygon network, formerly the Matic network, is an Ethereum-scaling protocol that reduces cost and embeds high security. In a short span, Polygon has gained a high level of traction.

A string of solutions on a single network sets Polygon apart from other Ethereum scaling projects. It empowers developers to zero in on a scaling solution that works best with their applications. Polygon Labs has been consistently working to develop scaling solutions based on plasma sidechains, a blockchain bridge, different types of zero-knowledge proofs and Optimistic Rollups.

Processing bundles of transactions on the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain drastically reduces the burden on the Ethereum main chain, making transactions faster. The throughput rate in the Ethereum base layer is roughly 14 transactions per second, while Polygon has the potential to handle exponentially higher transactions per second. 

Anyone wanting to participate in the network by updating transactional data on the system must stake Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8801

. In the Polygon network, a validator’s job is to ensure the network’s security and add transactions to blocks. Validators stake, allowing users to delegate tokens in exchange for rewards net of any commissions charged by validators. 

Staking of MATIC, explained

Anyone looking to stake MATIC has to delegate tokens to a validator. Stakers can earn rewards against the staked funds. For now, there are no minimum staking requirements though validators can decide the minimum acceptable limit for staking. Validators might charge fees or commissions for these services. Staked MATIC tokens have an unlocking period of 80 checkpoints, approximately three to four days. Stakers wanting to exit just need to send an unbound request.

It helps to factor in validators’ credibility before delegating funds to any of them. One can hop to the Polygon staking dashboard to get information about validators, viewing metrics such as active validators, their uptime, commission and the amount required to stake. These metrics are valuable tools to help select reliable validator(s):

Uptime refers to the number of blocks signed in a specific time period. A validator’s uptime should be close to 100%. Otherwise, it indicates the validator is unreliable, as reflected in their public performance metrics.
Commission rate is the percentage of one’s rewards the validator receives for their services.
The stake amount indicates the total number of tokens delegated to a validator.
How to stake MATIC on MetaMask

MetaMask is a decentralized, noncustodial cryptocurrency wallet that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet is accessible as a mobile app and browser extension on Google Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Opera and Edge.

Here are the steps to stake MATIC on MetaMask:

Step 1:  Add MetaMask as a browser extension.

To stake MATIC on MetaMask, users need to visit the MetaMask website and set it up as a browser extension. Go to “Download.” One can choose between the currently used browser and iOS or Android. Select the download option for the browser to add MetaMask.

Step 2: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon blockchain.

MetaMask is compatible with different blockchains. To connect MetaMask to Polygon, go to “Networks” and “Add network.” In the window that appears, users must populate relevant data regarding the Polygon blockchain.

Step 3: Transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask.

To transfer MATIC tokens to the MetaMask wallet, copy the address from the wallet and feed it in as the destination address on the exchange or another wallet. Now, transfer MATIC tokens to MetaMask. 

Step 4: Connect MetaMask to the Polygon Wallet.

On the following link, click “MetaMask” to connect MetaMask to the Polygon wallet. https://wallet.polygon.technology/ 

Step 5: Stake MATIC via MetaMask.

Once the connection is established, staking is enabled.

Step 6: Delegate MATIC.

Select a validator to which tokens will be delegated.

One needs to use the control panel for staking. Click on the button “Apps” and then select “Staking.” Put the validator’s name in the search bar and click “Delegate.” All relevant information, such as the number of tokens staked, uptime and commission amount, is visible next to the validator’s name.

Feed in the MATIC amount for staking and click “Continue.” In the pop-up extension window, click “Confirm.” The transaction might take a few minutes to complete, depending on traffic.

To execute a transaction, stake MATIC and begin receiving rewards, users must buy a voucher and pay for gas. Click “Buy Voucher.” Specify details like the gas limit and price, and re-confirm the transaction.

Delegation is now complete. Users can “Stake more” or withdraw the rewards using the control panel. However, note that all transactions on the Ethereum network are paid in Ether 

ETH

$1,855

. Therefore, the delegator must have enough ETH in the wallet to pay for the transactions.

How to stake MATIC on Coinbase Wallet

To stake MATIC on Coinbase, users need to use a wallet, as they don’t provide a staking feature on the exchange. If users have funds on the exchange but not in the wallet, they will need to move funds to the wallet. Even though Coinbase Wallet doesn’t have a built-in staking feature, there is a way to do it.

Here are the steps leading to staking MATIC on Coinbase Wallet.

Step 1: Install Coinbase wallet.

Install Coinbase Wallet on your smartphone. If it is an iPhone, go to the Apple App Store; visit the Play Store for Android.

The process includes creating a new wallet, agreeing to the terms of service, picking a username, setting privacy preferences, creating a passcode and backing up the wallet with a recovery phrase to help access the account in case users forget the passcode.

Step 2: Move funds to the wallet.

Open the wallet and go down to the bottom right. Tap there and scroll down the screen that appears. The link “Connect to Coinbase” will be visible. Hit the link, and it will ask for authorization. Once done, the wallet will establish the user’s connection to their wallet.

Hit “Buy or transfer.” When the exchange prompts you to select a coin, select “MATIC wallet.” Now, users can feed in the number of coins they want to transfer. The wallet will ask for a verification code. Once successfully deposited, funds will be transferred. MATIC tokens on Coinbase exchange are ERC-20 tokens, meaning they run on top of the Ethereum network. 

Step 3: Stake MATIC.

Visit the  Polygon website. On the top menu, click “Use Polygon” and “Staking.” On the next page, click “Become a delegator.”

The user is taken to a page displaying a list of validators and their relevant details. One can sort the list in line with four parameters: performance, commission, stake and random, by clicking a drop-down list on the right of the page. The user can view the validators as a grid or a list. They can also search for a specific validator using a search box on the left.

When users click any of the validators, they are taken to the page displaying further details of the relevant validator, such as MATIC staked, the commission asked, checkpoints signed and health status. Users can go through the list and click any validator.

A different page displays further details of the validator. This includes the amount of MATIC their Ethereum wallet balance holds and its value in dollars, their stake, heimdall fee, rewards earned, performance index, checkpoints signed and more. Heimdall fees refer to the fees the validator has to pay using the Polygon network to submit checkpoints.

The user must log in by clicking the button at the top-right using their credentials. Users without an account on Polygon must create one and click the “Become a Delegator” button.

Users need to populate the number of MATIC coins they intend to delegate and tap “Continue.” When the user clicks “Continue,” a pop-up appears. The user must tap the “Delegate” button to complete the process.

How to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet

Trust Wallet is a decentralized, noncustodial mobile app wallet for storing, exchanging and transferring crypto assets. Here is the process to stake MATIC on Trust Wallet:

Step 1: Set up a Trust Wallet. 

Set up a Trust Wallet on your mobile phone. Select the preferred operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app.

If users have already been using Trust Wallet, they must import the wallet. Otherwise, they have to set up a new wallet. To import an existing wallet, click the “I already have a wallet” button and  confirm a six-digit passcode.

If a user is uninitiated with the wallet, they must read and agree to the privacy policy and terms of service, create and confirm a six-digit passcode and back up the wallet with a recovery phrase.

Trust Wallet allows a wallet for several coins, but a multicoin wallet is usually the most suitable. As MATIC staking occurs on Ethereum, one requires an adequate amount of ETH and MATIC on the Ethereum mainnet.

Step 2: Connect Trust Wallet to Polygon. 

Log in to the Polygon staking dashboard and click “Become a Delegator.” From the list of wallets, select “WalletConnect” to connect to Trust Wallet on Polygon. A QR code will appear on the screen.

Return to the Trust Wallet app, go to the settings and choose WalletConnect. Click the “New Connection” button. Scan the QR code on the Polygon staking dashboard. Click “Confirm” to establish the connection.

Step 3: Delegate and approve transaction.

Select the validator and click “Delegate.” Feed the number of MATIC coins to be staked and click “Continue.” To approve the transaction, confirm the smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app.

Get back to the Polygon staking dashboard and click “Delegate.” Confirm yet another smart contract call in the Trust Wallet app. Delegation is active and users can begin accruing rewards. 

How to stake using Ledger

Ledger is a popular device for storing cryptocurrencies. Before staking MATIC with Ledger, one needs to prepare for it.

Step 1: Prepare for staking.

The process starts with updating Ledger Live to the latest version using the link: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download 

Connect the Ledger device to “My Ledger” and install the latest version of the ETH app on the Ledger device. Enable blind signing in the ETH app settings. When the preparation process is completed, Close Ledger Live or problems might arise when working with MetaMask.

Users also need to ensure MATIC is stored in the Ledger Ethereum account and not in the Polygon account, as MATIC staking happens on the Ethereum network.

Step 2: Connect Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.

Connect the Ledger device to the desktop and open the ETH app within. Now, link the Ledger ETH account to MetaMask.

Once the connection is established, go to the Polygon Wallet app.

Connect your Ledger Ether account to MetaMask by following these steps. 

Once done, go to the Polygon Web Wallet app, select “Connect to a Wallet” and then MetaMask.

When MetaMask opens in the browser, select the Ledger account, click “Next” and then “Connect.” Ledger displays “Sign message.” Select “Sign message” and simultaneously press both buttons to confirm. Now, MetaMask is connected to the Polygon Wallet app.

Step 3: Select a validator.

Select “Polygon Staking.” In the app’s top-right corner, click the “Login” button and select MetaMask again.

Choose a validator from the list that appears. Users need to consider two parameters: a high score for “Checkpoint signed” and a low “Commission.” 

Step 4: Delegate.

Click the “Delegate” button, fill in the amount of MATIC to be staked and click “Continue.” MetaMask displays “Give permission to access your MATIC?”

Review the fee amount; if it looks satisfactory, click “Confirm.” Ledger now displays “Review transaction.”

Select “Accept and send” and press both buttons simultaneously to “sign the transaction.” Ledger now displays “Application is ready.”

Return to the Polygon Web Wallet App, select a validator and click “Delegate.”

Review and confirm the transaction through MetaMask and Ledger devices. When the Ethereum network confirms the transaction, the screen will display “Delegation Completed.”

How to stake MATIC using ZenGo wallet

ZenGo is a self-compatible wallet. It’s compatible with WalletConnect, with no seed phrase vulnerability. Let’s go through how users can stake MATIC using a ZenGo wallet.

Step 1: Install the ZenGo wallet on your mobile phone.

Visit the ZenGo website, select an operating system (iOS or Android) and install the app on the mobile phone. To accelerate the search, one can scan the QR code.

Open the ZenGo app, enter an email address and tap “Continue.” ZenGo requires the user to confirm their email address. For confirmation, reach the inbox by tapping “Open My Email” in the ZenGo app, then tap “Tap to Confirm” in the email received. After email address verification, enable biometrics to make the app even more secure.

Create a Recovery Kit for the safety of funds and easy access when changing devices. As a noncustodial wallet, ZenGo shares an encrypted secret key share. Part of the key stored on the device helps unlock the wallet and use it with a face scan. Once the Recovery Kit is created, tap “Done.”

Step 2: Connect ZenGo wallet to Polygon.

Users need to connect the ZenGo wallet to Polygon. Open the link https://staking.polygon.technology/ 

Go to the Polygon staking dashboard. In the upper right part of the screen, tap “Login.”

Tap WalletConnect from the list of available connections. WalletConnect protocol enables one to connect ZenGo to Polygon. The QR code will appear.

Go to the ZenGo wallet homepage and tap the “Connect to Apps” button in the upper right corner. Scan the QR code.

Step 3: Select a validator and delegate MATIC.

Now begins the process of delegating MATIC. Make sure to have MATIC in ERC-20 and 0.05–0.1 ETH for fees, as the delegation happens on the Ethereum mainnet.

On the Polygon staking dashboard, scroll down to find information such as the network’s overview, active validators, their amount of stake, uptime, commission, amount of stake and health metrics.

Select a validator after considering the metrics and tap “Delegate” at the bottom-right of the screen.

In the pop-up box that appears, users need to enter the amount of MATIC to be staked and tap “Continue.” You can stake with an amount as low as 1 MATIC. To confirm the transaction, return to the ZenGo app and approve the transaction in the pop-up window.

Revisit the Polygon staking dashboard and tap “Delegate.” In the ZenGo wallet, confirm the transaction and wait for approval.

Once delegation is active, the user will begin receiving rewards. At each checkpoint, rewards get accrued.

Rewards are received in the “My Account” section of the Polygon staking dashboard. Users can also unstake, stake to multiple validators or restake funds. To withdraw the rewards accrued, users must have a minimum of 2 MATIC in their account.

The road ahead

As a prominent layer-2 network, the Polygon protocol is a solution that helps Ethereum expand in size, security, efficiency and use cases. As the unit of payment and settlement in the network, MATIC helps power the system. The Matic network went live in 2020, rebranded to Polygon in February 2021, and is being used by developers to build Ethereum-compatible decentralized applications.

The Polygon protocol has been instrumental in making Ethereum usable and pulling it out of the mess the blockchain found itself in after rapid growth. Transactions were stuck for hours over a lack of scalability, with the cost of executing transactions often more than the transaction amount itself. The Polygon protocol has effectively transformed Ethereum into a full-fledged multichain system with the advantages of Ethereum’s decentralization and vibrancy.

MATIC token is here to stay and keeps playing an increasingly important role in retaining the functionality of Ethereum ecosystem. Staking, meanwhile, will serve as a mechanism to ensure proper governance and security of the network.

Criticism has been leveled at a new euro-pegged stablecoin released in France due to a decision to restrict peer-to-peer transactions.

French bank Societe Generale-Forge (SGF) released the Ethereum-based stablecoin called EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on April 20, which is available to only qualified institutional clients.

According to observers who reviewed its smart contract code, itsERC-20 transfers need to first be approved by a centralized registrar — presumably one controlled by the bank — before the transaction is processed.

In an April 20 tweet, pseudonymous smart contract engineer “alephv.eth” explained:

“They coded it so they have to whitelist all users, process all user transfers, and even process your ERC20 approvals before they process your 'transferFrom' lmao.”

She further mocked the code in a separate post, stating it was a ""radical commitment to inefficiency in the name of regulation.""

Nonfungible token project founder “foobar” tweeted to his over 127,000 followers on April 20 that it’s “the worst code I’ve ever seen” and described the stablecoin as a “laughing stock.”

Crypto researcher Mason Versluis tweeted that the code was “absolutely horrible” and suggested the French bank “stop trying to weasel” into crypto.

Plenty of others chipped in on the criticism, but Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 investor Ryan Berckman provided a more neutral analysis.

He explained that many traditional financial firms like SGF will take “baby steps” as they move into blockchain and digital assets:

“Obviously, non-compliant, non-composable, allowlist-style stables are going to be uncompetitive in the market. Baby steps, they are coming from tradfi, they’ll see it soon enough and switch to a USDC-style denylist.”

Berckman explained SGF may also be incorrect in its claim to be the first bank to launch an institutional stablecoin on a public blockchain. He pointed to the AUDN stablecoin minted on Ethereum in March by National Australia Bank (NAB), which claimed to be the second bank to launch a stablecoin.

Regardless, Berckman expects more banks to follow suit in the months to come, stating that he is “certain” SGF won’t be the last bank to launch a stablecoin on a public network.

SGF’s stablecoin isn’t intended for public use — at least to begin with.

EURCV is only strictly available to institutional clients onboarded by the bank through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, according to the bank’s April 20 announcement.

The stablecoin is designed to bridge the gap between assets in traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem.

A total of 10 million EURCV tokens were minted on Ethereum on April , according to Ethereum explorer Etherscan. All 10 million tokens are held by one wallet address.

The stablecoin was launched on the back of growing demand for a new settlement asset to process on-chain transactions.

The Prosecutor’s Office of the State of Podgorica has indicted former Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Kwon for allegedly forging legal documents, the Korean industry-focused news agency Block Media reported on April 20.

The charges came a few weeks after Kwon was arrested on March 23 while trying to board a private plane at an airport in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. He allegedly was using fake documents while attempting to board the flight to Dubai.

Han Chang-jun, Terraform’s former chief financial officer, is facing similar charges, the report says. Han was arrested with Kwon in Podgorica in March.

Following the issuance of the indictments, Montenegro prosecutors have reportedly requested an extension of the detention period for the two former Terraform executives.

While Han and Kwon are facing charges in Montenegro, one other Terraform co-founder — Shin Hyun-seung, also known as Daniel Shin — is still walking free in South Korea. Local authorities have attempted to arrest the exec, but the Seoul Southern District Court denied the request. After questioning Shin, the court said that there was little likelihood that Shin would flee or destroy any evidence related to the fall of Terra.

The news comes amid more global prosecutors reaching major milestones in procedures involving some crypto execs. On April 20, the Turkish police finally detained Faruk Fatih Ozer, founder and former CEO of Thodex, who allegedly fled Turkey with $2 billion stolen from the exchange in 2021.

Also on April 20, Cointelegraph confirmed that Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was set to be released from jail after Dutch authorities arrested him in August. The developer is expected to be back home by April 26, which happens to be his birthday.

The price of Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 has almost doubled after bottoming out at $0.0491 in June 2022, alongside a similar recovery across the cryptocurrency market.

On April 20, DOGE was trading for as high as $0.0942, up around 94% versus last year’s bottom. But despite its impressive rebound, its price is still 88% below its all-time high of $0.76 set in May 2021. Thus, the DOGE/USD pair remains far from establishing a decisive bullish reversal on longer timeframes.

Dogecoin’s bullish reversal ahead?

Dogecoin price soared over 23,000% in 2021 primarily due to Elon Musk’s vocal support. Ironically, DOGE/USD topped after Musk called it a “hustle” during his Saturday Night Live appearance in May 2021.

DOGE price entered a prolonged long bearish cycle, furthered by the prospects of the Fed tightening (leading to actual interest rate cuts in 2022 and 2023). Also, the collapse of multiple leading crypto firms, such as Terra (LUNA), Three Arrow Capital, FTX, etc., exacerbated the DOGE selloff. 

October 2022 saw a 100% price rebound despite the multi-month downtrend. The recovery coincided with Musk’s shaky takeover of Twitter amid hopes that DOGE would become the social media platform’s official payment token. 

As of April 2023, Musk has not added a DOGE payment option on Twitter, but he did briefly replace the platform’s iconic bluebird logo with the Dogecoin official mascot from the Shiba Inu meme earlier in the month. DOGE rallied by up to 40% on the news.

From a fundamental perspective, speculation can help Dogecoin sustain its year-to-date gains. But the all-time high price is still 700% away, which is likely to happen only it receives wider adoption, such as for Twitter payments.

DOGE price technicals

In fractal analysis terms, Dogecoin's bullish reversal prospects depend on holding above its two key weekly exponential moving averages (EMA).

Related: Is Dogecoin coming to Twitter? Watch The Market Report

Notably, DOGE price has attempted to close above its 50-week (the red wave) near $0.0917 and 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near $0.0895. That is similar to its sideways action and breakout attempts in April-November 2020 that preceded a 30,000% price rally.

DOGE/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView

DOGE may not undergo a similar 30,000% price rally in 2023 due to conflicting fundamentals. But in the event of an interest rate pivot from the Fed or the addition of Dogecoin payments to Twitter, the memecoin could eye a run-up toward its record high of $0.76 in 2023.   

Conversely, a reversal from the aforementioned EMAs risks triggering a classic continuation setup called the ascending triangle.

The pattern appears on a chart when the price fluctuates between rising trendline support and horizontal trendline resistance. It typically resolves after the price breaks out in the direction of its previous trend.

As a result of its previous downtrend, DOGE's ascending triangle appears to favor the bears, eyeing downside targets at lengths equal to the pattern's maximum height from the potential breakout point.

That puts DOGE's yearend price target inside the $0.0363-0.0469 range, down 45-60% from the current price levels, respectively.

The wallet address, linked to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain “jaredfromsubway.eth,” made $950,000 from the sandwich attacks on April 18 and profited about $300,000 and $400,000 on April 17 and 19, respectively, according to an April 19 tweet from nonfungible token data platform Sealaunch.

The bot’s ENS domain is a likely tongue-in-cheek nod to the popular sandwich chain and its disgraced former spokesperson Jared Fogle.

Over a 24-hour period between April 18 to 19, 7% of all Ethereum gas fees were spent by the MEV bot, Sealaunch explained in a separate post.

A large proportion of the profits came from attacks on trading activity relating to two new meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) and Wojak (WOJAK), which has helped propel jaredfromsubway.eth to the become the largest gas guzzler over the last day and week, crypto researcher Matt Willemsen explained:

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

This is possible because the victim’s transaction is first sent to the mempool where it waits to be added to the next block. In the meantime, the attacker sets one transaction with a high gas fee — to ensure it is accepted first — and another transaction with a lower gas fee to ensure it is accepted after the victim's transaction.

The attacker profits by buying the victim’s token at a price cheaper than market value, then sells it within the same block — taking in the difference between the revenue from the transaction minus the gas fees.

The large profits pocketed by jaredfromsubway.eth came from nearly $1.2 million being spent on gas fees between April 18 and 19, according to data shared by Thomas Mattimore, head of platform at the Reserve Protocol.

The MEV bot operator has spent over $7 million in gas fees across 180,000 transactions, according to Sealaunch.

While some are finding the humor in the MEV bot’s domain name and actions, not all are happy.

One analyst for on-chain analytics firm Glassnode questioned the “value” of the work jaredfromsubway.eth is providing to the world.

Other Twitter users went one step further, expressing their hatred and frustration toward the MEV bot operator.

According to MEV Blocker, MEV bots have extracted more than $1.38 billion from Ethereum users attempting to trade, provide liquidity and mint NFTs.

Several MEV Block projects have been launched in recent months to help protect Ethereum users from sandwich attacks.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 has been witnessing volatile moves in the past three days. The pick-up in volatility shows that the buyers and sellers are vying for supremacy. 

Bitcoin recovered sharply on April 18 but gave back all the gains on April 19. The latest sell-off may have been triggered by the high inflation figures in the United Kingdom and the regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Profit booking was not limited to Bitcoin, as most major altcoins also turned lower.

While a deep correction is possible, Glassnode said in its analysis on April 17 that several on-chain indicators are pointing toward the end of the bear market. If that is the case, the dips may be viewed as a buying opportunity by long-term investors.

What are the important support levels that are likely to be guarded by the bulls? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin is witnessing a keen battle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,092). The bears are trying to sink the price below the 20-day EMA while the bulls are attempting to start a strong rebound.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.

The bulls will then make one more attempt to overcome the resistance zone between $31,000 and $32,000. If they succeed, it will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The BTC/USDT pair may then soar to $40,000.

The bears are likely to have other plans. If they tug the price below the 20-day EMA, the selling could accelerate and the pair may slump to $27,800 and, subsequently, to $26,500.

Ether price analysis

The bulls tried to resume the uptrend in Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 on April 18, but the bears remained sellers near the overhead resistance at $2,200.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ETH/USDT pair has pulled back to the 20-day EMA ($1,949), which is just below the psychological support of $2,000. This is an important support for the bulls to defend because a break and close above it may tilt the advantage in favor of the sellers. The pair may first collapse to $1,800 and, later, to $1,700.

Instead, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip the $2,000 level into support. If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to $2,200. A break and close above this level will clear the path for a potential rally to $3,000.

BNB price analysis

Buyers defended the $338 level on April 17 and 18 but failed to push the price above the $350 resistance. That may have emboldened the bears, who pulled BNB 

BNB

$314

 to the 20-day EMA ($325) on April 19.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

This is an important level to keep an eye on because if it cracks, the selling could intensify and the BNB/USDT pair may nosedive to the 200-day simple moving average ($294). This level is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls.

Another possibility is that the price turns up quickly from the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are buying the pullbacks. They will then make another attempt to kick the price above $350. If they can pull it off, the pair may shoot up to $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.43

 rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.50) on April 18, but the bulls could not clear the overhead hurdle at the resistance line.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The price turned down sharply on April 19 and collapsed below the 20-day EMA ($0.50). However, the long tail on the candlestick shows that the buyers are trying to arrest the decline at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.47.

Any attempt to recover is likely to face strong selling in the zone between the resistance line and $0.58. On the downside, a break below $0.47 could drag the XRP/USDT pair down to the 200-day SMA ($0.41). The bulls are likely to aggressively buy the dips to this level.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 is in a pullback, which has reached the breakout level of the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price snaps back from the neckline, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That will enhance the prospect of a break above $0.46. The ADA/USDT pair may then start its northward march toward the pattern target of $0.60. The $0.52 level may act as a resistance, but it is likely to be crossed.

Contrary to this assumption, if bears pull the price below the neckline, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then tumble to the 200-day SMA ($0.35), where the bulls may step in to arrest the decline.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 had been gradually moving higher, but the bulls hit a wall near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.10.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.09), but they could not sustain the lower levels. The bulls bought the dip and started a recovery, as seen from the long tail on the April 19 candlestick.

If buyers maintain the buying pressure and push the price above $0.10, the DOGE/USDT pair could reach the crucial resistance at $0.11. Alternatively, a break below the 200-day SMA ($0.08) may keep the pair range-bound between $0.11 and $0.07 for some time.

Polygon price analysis

After trading near the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern for a few days, Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8801

 turned down and reached the support line.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattening 20-day EMA ($1.13) and the RSI below 50 indicate that the bulls may be losing their grip. If the price breaks below the support line, it will tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The MATIC/USDT pair may then collapse to the 200-day SMA ($1) where the buyers are likely to mount a strong defense.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the resistance line. That could open the doors for a potential rally to $1.30.

Solana price analysis

The failure of the bulls to drive Solana 

SOL

$21

 above the $27.12 resistance may have attracted short-term bulls to book profits.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The SOL/USDT pair slipped below the 20-day EMA ($22.82) on April 19, but the long tail on the candlestick suggests that the bulls are trying to protect the level. If the price turns up from the current level, the buyers will again try to kick the pair above $27.12 and commence the journey toward $39.

On the other hand, if the price breaks below the 200-day SMA ($21.02), it will signal that the pair may consolidate between $27.12 and $15.28 for a few days.

Polkadot price analysis

Polkadot 

DOT

$5.36

 bounced off the 20-day EMA ($6.49) on April 18, but the bears continued to defend the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.85.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Strong selling by the bears yanked the price below the 20-day EMA on April 19, but the bulls are attempting to guard the uptrend line. If the price turns up from the uptrend line, the buyers will again try to resume the up-move and propel the DOT/USDT pair to the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern.

On the contrary, if the uptrend line gives way, the bears will try to sink the pair to $5.70. This is an important level to keep an eye on because below it, the pair could drop to $5.15.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 rose above the immediate resistance of $96 on April 14 and reached $103 on April 18, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Aggressive profit-booking by the bears pulled the price back below the support at $96. This suggests that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. The selling could accelerate further if the price dips and sustains below the 20-day EMA ($94). The LTC/USDT pair could then extend its decline to $85.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest that bulls continue to accumulate at lower levels. The bulls will then again try to push the price to the stiff overhead resistance at $106.

Cryptocurrency wallet provider MetaMask has denied claims that an exploit of its wallet is the cause of a “massive wallet draining operation” that has claimed over 5,000 Ether

On April 18, MetaMask tweeted in response to a series of tweets posted on April 17 by Taylor Monahan, the founder of Ethereum wallet manager MyCrypto, who explained an unidentified wallet-draining exploit has stolen over $10.5 million in crypto and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) since December 2022.

“Recent reporting on [Monahan’s] thread has incorrectly claimed that a massive wallet-draining operation is a result of a MetaMask exploit,” MetaMask said.

“This is incorrect. This is not a MetaMask-specific exploit,” it added.

The wallet provider said the 5,000 ETH was stolen “from various addresses across 11 blockchains,” reaffirming the claim that funds were hacked from MetaMask “is incorrect.”

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Wallet Guard co-founder Ohm Shah said the MetaMask team has been “researching tirelessly,” and there is “no solid answer to how this has happened.”

“There are tons of independent security researchers also investigating this,” Shah said.

He speculated it was possible to assume that there had been “some sort of private key or seed phrase leak.”

In its latest series of tweets, MetaMask confirmed its security team was researching the source of the exploit and was “working with others across the Web3 wallet space”

In her thread on the exploit, Monahan stated that “no one knows how” this massive attack was conducted, but her “best guess” was that a significant amount of old data was obtained and used to extract the funds.

She also originally claimed the attacker was draining long-time MetaMask users and employees by using MetaMask.

Monahan later stated the exploit is not MetaMask-specific and “users of all wallets, even those created on a hardware wallet,” have been impacted by the exploit.

EU sets up research hub to analyze Big Tech’s AI algorithms

The research unit will be tasked with auditing the AI-backed algorithms used by large technology firms such as Google and Meta.

The European Commission has launched a new research unit that will investigate the impact of the algorithms made and used by prominent online platforms and search engines such as Facebook and Google.

The European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency launched on April 18 and will help the European Commission identify and address any potential risks posed by these platforms.

ECAT will be embedded within the European Union’s existing Joint Research Centre, which conducts research on a broad range of subjects including artificial intelligence.

Like the design of the Las Setas building in Seville, algorithms are complex structures that shape our online experience.

This is what we are working on at the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency. We want to make the online experience safer for all.#DigitalEU

— European Commission (@EU_Commission) April 18, 2023

The team will consist of “data scientists, AI experts, social scientists and legal experts” who will analyze and evaluate the AI-backed algorithms used by Big Tech firms.

AI-based programs are built using a series of complex algorithms, meaning ECAT will also be looking at algorithms that underpin AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which some believe could eventually replace search engines.

4. New systems like Microsoft’s Bing chatbot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT threaten traditional search engines such as Google, which may explain why Samsung is reportedly considering replacing Google with Bing as its default search engine.

— Debrieft (@thedebrieft) April 17, 2023

On its website, the commission claims that ECAT will conduct algorithmic accountability and transparency audits, as required by the Digital Services Act, a set of European Union rules enforceable as of Nov. 16, 2022.

According to the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, ECAT will “look under the hood” of large search engines and online platforms in order to “see how their algorithms function and contribute to the spread of illegal and harmful content.”

Related: UK may have crypto regulation within a year, says senior minister

Nearly a dozen EU politicians called for the “safe” development of AI in a signed open letter on April 16.

The lawmakers asked United States President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to convene a summit on AI and agree on a set of governing principles for the development, control and deployment of the tech.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk also had issues with the development of AI, arguing on an April 17 Fox News interview that AI chatbots like ChatGPT have a left-wing bias and said that he was developing an alternative called “TruthGPT.”

NFT app Rebase co-founder denies going ‘rogue’ as alleged in suit by partner

An apparent business partner of Rebase’s co-founder claims that he was pushed out of the firm and funds he owned were moved from a joint crypto wallet.

This article was updated to reflect that Rebase and Edmond Truong deny the claims put forward, in addition to recent comments shared by Krzysztof Gagacki.

Nonfungible token (NFT) project Rebase and its co-founder Edmond Truong has categorically denied accusations made by fellow co-founder and business partner, Krzysztof Gagacki in a recent lawsuit filing.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

Gagacki claimed in an April 17 filing that Truong went ""rogue"" by stealing $2 million from a joint crypto wallet and ousted him from the firm.

In total, eight separate claims were made against Truong in a United States District Court in California, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, defamation and trademark infringement. Gagacki is now demanding a jury trial.

Gagacki told Cointelegraph that he has shared ""a wealth of evidence"" with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Attorney's office to support his claims.

In a message to Cointelegraph, Rebase stressed that Gagacki's claims are ""not true and contain misinformation.""

The firm explained that its legal team is now working on finding the root cause of Gagacki's claims, which they say have caused concern to their stakeholders:

""Our legal team is currently investigating the source of the false information and will take appropriate action to protect the interests of our company and our stakeholders.""

""We take our responsibility to maintain the trust and confidence of our clients, employees, and investors very seriously and will not tolerate any misrepresentation of our company or its operations,"" the firm added.

While it is unclear exactly when the professional relationship between the two deteriorated, Gagacki alleged that Truong breached a partnership contract on Oct. 27, 2022, by misappropriating $2 million into a separate wallet owned and controlled by Truong without his consent.

Gagacki claims to own a 50% share of the funds and says Truong refuses to provide him with the private keys to the digital wallet. Truong, in turn, denied the claims when speaking to Cointelegraph.

In the filing, Gagacki claims Troung “ousted” him from the business by presenting himself to third parties as the “sole owner” and “decision maker” for Rebase.

He further alleges that Troung is stating Gagacki is no longer “employed” at the firm after things had “gotten a bit out of hand.” A LinkedIn account owned by Gagacki does not list an employment history at Rebase.

Truong also allegedly “intentionally interfered” with several prospective deals that Gagacki had been working on for the firm in addition to making several defamatory statements to the firm’s business contacts about Gagacki.

Gagacki claims these statements have had a “disastrous effect” on his reputation.

One of the deals involved American celebrity Bella Hadid, who featured in the firm’s Cy-B3lla NFT project but then refused further collaboration after it was made apparent to her that the two business partners clashed heads, the filing claimed.

Truong also allegedly seized a Twitter account relating to Hadid’s NFT collection, which Gagacki claims to have the trademark rights for with his other company, IOVO AG:

“[Truong] has also commandeered the @REBASEgg and @cybellaxyz Twitter accounts. Specifically, [Truong] has changed the password for these accounts and is actively denying Mr. Gagacki access.”

Another claim mentioned by Gagacki was Truong’s unauthorized pursuit to issue a Rebase token on the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution Arbirtrum.

If a token is issued, there may have serious ramifications for Rebase, the filing explained:

“If a Rebase app token is listed on any major cryptocurrency exchange, the market value of the tokens, which will be minted on the Arbitrum network and offered to the public, could reach many times over the Rebase app’s last round valuation of $150,000,000.”

According to the firm’s Twitter account, Rebase is set to integrate on Arbitrum on April 21:

The firm’s $150 million valuation has come on the back of venture capital funding from Animoca Capital, Anti Fund Investment Fund, LLC, DeFiance Capital and the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital.

Despite the court filing, Gagacki told Cointelegraph that he still deeply cares about the Rebase community and wishes ""this action had not become necessary.""

Trump drops series 2 NFT collection ahead of presidential run

Another round of digital nonfungible tokens (NFTs) trading cards dropped bearing the likeness of former United States President Donald Trump, with 38,001 minted on Polygon.

The collection was launched on April 18 at $99 each and had a floor price of 0.0659 Ether (ETH) or $145 at the time of writing, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea, racking up a volume of 592 ETH ($1.2 million).

Based on the collections creator fee of 10%, the sales have generated over $100,000, while the initial subscription generated an additional $3.76 million of revenue based on a sale price of $99.

Posting to Instagram, Trump suggested that he kept the price the same as it was for the first series “because I want my fans & supporters to make money, & have fun doing it,” adding:

“I could have raised the price MUCH HIGHER, I believe it still would have sold well, with a lot more money coming to me, but I didn’t choose to do so. I WILL BE GIVEN NO ‘NICE GUY’ CREDIT?”

The initial series, unveiled on Dec. 15, 2022, has seen its floor price drop by 61% in the last 24 hours, according to OpenSea, although the trading volume has increased by 1,011%.

Meta opens Horizon Worlds to teens in a bid for more users

Teens from the U.S. and Canada can now use the virtual reality (VR) app Horizon Worlds after Big Tech firm Meta opened it up on April 18. It was previously restricted to people aged 18 and over.

The decision comes after Horizon Worlds fell well short of its monthly active user goal for 2022, recording an average of just 280,000 over the year compared with the 500,000 it had targeted, according to the data website Statista.

Various advocacy organizations and safety groups have urged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to halt plans to allow minors into its metaverse. An April 14 open letter argued that Meta should wait for more peer-reviewed research on the potential risks of allowing youths in the metaverse.

The letter claimed minors will face harassment and privacy violations on the VR app, which is still in its early stages.

Meta’s Horizon Worlds isn’t safe for kids, and @Fairplayforkids has the receipts. Children’s wellbeing should be a priority, not an afterthought, and Meta can’t even manage that on existing platforms. https://t.co/WhAEnBRo0M

— Tech Transparency Project (@TTP_updates) April 17, 2023

Meta’s announcement appeared to target the concerns as it focused heavily on ways it plans to mitigate these risks through features such as parental supervision tools, and limiting interactions between teens and adult strangers.

A newcomer to the blockchain game Illuvium sold an NFT for over $49,000 after finding a rare NFT inside a digital loot box. The loot box cost just $32, meaning the lucky player made a gain of approximately 140,525%.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, art market economist and academic Magnus Resch suggested “the most important pillar in any NFT project is the community” and believes that some NFT projects have failed because they treated their community like an audience that follows their project rather than contributing to it.

Solana saw two positive developments this week with the launch of the Saga Android-based smartphone powered by the Solana blockchain and the retail trading debut of Grayscale Solana Trust shares.

The developments, along with bullishness in the broader market, boosted the price of Solana 

SOL

$21

 by 29.05% from April 11 to a monthly high of $26.03.

While the mobile launch positively boosts the Solana ecosystem, the Saga phone appears overpriced at over $1,000 apiece. Nevertheless, the smartphone received positive reviews in user experience and quality.

Independent cryptocurrency investor Amy Wu noted that there are a lot of opportunities for more “Saga-exclusive dApps, games, and rewards as the phone ships globally, which will also make it easier to justify the $1k premium price.” It remains to be seen how the Solana Foundation will lead the marketing efforts for the phone against existing giants like Samsung and Apple.

The Grayscale Solana Trust has only $2.9 million in assets under management — which is low compared to the 24-hour daily trading volume of SOL, which surpassed $500 million — and is unlikely to have an impact on price.

There are also warning signs of lack of growth across on-chain metrics and bullishness across the derivatives market, threatening a steep correction.

NFTs carry the Solana ecosystem

The number of daily transactions on Solana reached a new all-time high in April, showing a consistent uptrend. However, the number of daily active accounts have dipped to new lows, which raises some concerns.

Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem subsided after FTX’s collapse, with significant liquidity drained. The total deposits on Solana DeFi applications are less than $300 million, with Solana knocked out of the top 10 DeFi blockchains by liquidity value locked, per DefiLlama.

DeFi usage across the Solana ecosystem has been limited to liquidity staking protocols, with decentralized exchanges and lending protocols taking a back seat. It appears that nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are carrying the ecosystem.

Solana’s market share in NFT trading rose from 6% to 14% of total NFT sales volume in less than a year by February 2023, according to a Delphi Digital report. It is the second-largest NFT ecosystem after Ethereum.

The report added, “The Solana NFT ecosystem is driven by traders who are more financially incentivized and trade a lot more often compared to Ethereum NFT users.”

However, the NFT trading volumes have declined since February 2023 below the November 2022 level, which is a discouraging sign.

Additionally, the smart money activity has also compressed significantly, with fewer spending and gains made by “smart money” wallets. Nansen tags prolific and active trading addresses as “smart money.”

Solana price action

The open interest (OI) volume for SOL futures, which represents the number of open positions for SOL contracts, surged toward a 2023 high with a spike from $239 million to $365 million in the 48-hours following April 11, according to data from Coinglass.

The rise in SOL’s price coincides with the OI volume surge, suggesting that derivatives volumes are driving the latest uptrend.

The rise in OI volumes also accompanies a surge in the funding rates for perpetual swap contracts, suggesting that leverage traders are bullish on the coin. This is a bearish contrarian signal, as the market usually runs the stops of crowded perpetual orders.

The SOL/USD pair faces resistance from the 50-day exponential moving average at $25.40 and the 2022 breakdown levels around $29.76. The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator, a momentum indicator, shows a divergence between the price surge and the MACD indicator, hinting at a possible pullback. Support for the pair lies around the $20 level.

The Solana ecosystem’s growth in NFT trading volumes has been impressive, but it has declined since February 2023, and the smart money activity has compressed significantly.

The rise in open interest volumes for SOL futures and funding rates for perpetual swap contracts may suggest that derivatives volumes are driving the latest uptrend. Overall, while Solana has had positive developments, it remains to be seen how the ecosystem will sustain the price growth.

Gnosis Builders, developer of blockchain network Gnosis Chain, has announced a $5 million project to increase the number and diversity of validators through incentive mechanisms. The new project is called “Gnosis VIP,” according to an April 18 announcement from the company.

As part of the new project, Gnosis is launching a “Geographic Diversity Program” that seeks to increase the number of countries Gnosis Chain validators are located within.

The network currently has over 100,000 validators spread across 60 countries, and the program’s goal is to increase the number of countries to 180 by year’s end, the announcement said.

According to the program’s official webpage, for each of the 90 countries listed, the first ten validators that start operating within them will receive 388 meta Gnosis (worth $1,368.18 at April 12 prices) over the course of six months. Meta Gnosis (mGNO) is the wrapped and staked version of the network’s native coin, Gnosis (GNO). Each mGNO can be redeemed for 1/32 GNO.

The first payment of 38 mGNO ($134) will be disbursed after the first 30 days the node operates. The size of the payment will increase each month, and the last payment at the end of the six months will be for 98 mGNO ($345.57).

In an email statement to Cointelegraph, Gnosis CEO Martin Köppelmann expressed hope that the new program will help to improve both the security and performance of Gnosis Chain:

“A diverse validator set is paramount for a resilient and secure network [...] Geographical diversity hedges the network against both natural and jurisdictional disasters [and] can also improve the performance of a network; by having validators located in different parts of the world, transactions can be processed more quickly and efficiently.”

Debates often rage in the crypto community over which networks are the most decentralized, with many experts claiming that a network cannot be scalable, secure, and decentralized at the same time. This conflict in design philosophy is often called the blockchain trilemma.

In his email statement, Köppelmann emphasized that geographical diversity is only one aspect of decentralization, and others are also important to ensure resilience and security.

Bitcoin erases intraday losses

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as the pair suddenly added $500, delivering daily gains of more than 3%.

The pair had previously worried traders, who watched as the $30,000 support looked set to remain as longer-term resistance.

Before crossing the $30,000 mark, Binance order book activity was a focus for monitoring resource Material Indicators, which identified bid liquidity moving closer to spot price.

“Some has already started moving closer to the active trading zone. Watching to see if more of it follows or if price drops back into the $28s to fill,” part of the accompanying commentary read.

A subsequent update indicated that the largest class of high-volume traders, so-called “mega whales,” was responsible for the upward momentum.

Reacting to the latest BTC price action, Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, was optimistic.

“There we go for Bitcoin. Breaks through $30K, which means that we're back in the range,” he tweeted alongside a chart showing key levels.

“Most preferred a retest at $29.7K would suit continuation towards new highs and towards $40K.”

Further volatility was meanwhile a possibility on lower timeframes ahead of the Wall Street open.

Those banking on further downside were already feeling the pressure, with data from Coinglass showing $16 million of BTC short liquidations on the day.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, is disabling multiple old deposit addresses as part of its infrastructure upgrade.

In an announcement on April 18, Binance said it would retire selected deposit addresses and memos in batches on multiple blockchains, including Ether

$1,855

, Tron 

TRX

$0.0692

, BNB

The users of these impacted deposit blockchain addresses will be notified via email, and the exchange strongly encouraged that all impacted users obtain a new address and memo upon receiving the notification. The notification email will include the expiration date for any outdated deposit addresses. When users get a new address, old deposit addresses will become invalid.

To obtain a new deposit address, users must log in to their Binance account and follow the instructions mentioned in their email notification. The migration is scheduled for between April and June 2023.

The crypto exchange also assured that the funds wouldn’t be lost if someone mistakenly sent assets to expired addresses. However, payments made to addresses that have already expired will not be immediately reimbursed. Users must manually credit the deposits from the old address using the “transaction history” page.

Binance regularly upgrades and maintains its infrastructure from time to time. The exchange recently raised the alarm against 191 high-risk, untrustworthy decentralized applications and fake tokens on its native blockchain network called BNB Chain.

The change in deposit addresses of multiple blockchains, including that of Ethereum, comes just a day before Binance is set to open ETH withdrawal for users. Millions of Ether are now unlocked after the Shapella upgrades on April 12, with major exchanges and custodians having already made arrangements for users to unstake their ETH from the Beacon Chain nearly three years after staking it.

The Ethereum blockchain underwent a successful Shapella upgrade on April 12, allowing validators to withdraw their staked Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 from the Beacon Chain after three years. After seeing over 1 million ETH in withdrawals in the first week, the amount of staked ETH has now surpassed the number of ETH being withdrawn for the first time since the Shapella upgrade.

Data from the on-chain analytics firm Nansen suggests that more ETH is currently being staked than withdrawn. As of April 17, the ETH staking volume of 124,000 ETH exceeded the withdrawal volume of 64,800 ETH for the first time. In the last 24 hours, the amount of staked ETH was 94,968 against 27,076 in withdrawals. The first round was primarily partial withdrawals from Lido and old validators. It takes approximately three days to get into the withdrawal queue.

The Shapella upgrade was projected as a make-or-break situation for the Ethereum blockchain as millions in unlocked ETH posed a risk of mass selling. However, the majority of the validators are restaking their unlocked Ether. Crypto exchange Binance will open withdrawals on April 19.

Related: Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell off after the Shapella hard fork

Out of the 1 million withdrawn ETH, three addresses restaked a total of 19,844 ETH. Three addresses transferred ETH to centralized exchanges (CEXs) after withdrawal, with 71,444 ETH sent to different exchanges. Other whales did the same, with some sending it to Huobi staking addresses and a few others to CEXs, according to data shared by Lookonchain.

Most early withdrawals are staking rewards, and a few validators, like Kraken, had to exit to comply with a United States Securities and Exchange Commission ruling. Currently, 22,231 validators have signed up for a complete exit out of 574,624, while 910,930 ETH of the 18.6 million staked ETH is slated to be withdrawn.

Another prominent reason for the diminishing withdrawals could be ETH’s price, as the average price of staked ETH is about $2,137.

Privacy, scaling drives use cases for zero-knowledge technology

Zero-knowledge technology has seen significant growth in adoption within the blockchain space in 2023, according to an inaugural quarterly report published by ZKValidator.

A quarterly report focused on zero-knowledge (ZK) technology indicates that privacy, scaling and identity solutions are significant drivers of adoption in the blockchain space.

Validator service provider ZKValidator’s report titled “The State of ZK” explores insights from the zero-knowledge space, highlighting major and emerging use cases, research, product launches and notable investment rounds.

The key takeaway focuses on use cases of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs). The cryptographic method allows one party to verify data or a statement without exposing the information. Privacy stands out as the industry’s most significant driver of adoption at 12.9%. Scaling is the second most prominent use case for zero-knowledge technology, with 9.46%.

Identity solutions and new zero-knowledge use cases rank third and fourth, indicating that the blockchain ecosystem is interested in exploring how zero-knowledge technology can be applied in identity management and other novel applications. Zero-knowledge machine learning (ZK-ML) was also identified as the space’s most attractive new use case.

Insights were driven by the company’s work with industry participants, including ZK Hack, zkSummit, rhino.fi, Geometry and University College London. ZKValidator also gleaned data and information working with participants in the production and management of the Zero Knowledge Summit 9 in Lisbon on April 4.

The launch of Polygon and zkSync’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine’s (zkEVM) was also highlighted in zkValidator’s report, with key data from the two Ethereum scaling protocols.

Having launched over a month ago, zkSync Era has attracted more daily active users than Polygon’s zkEVM. The report speculates that rumors of a possible zkSync airdrop later in 2023 may be a reason for the gulf in user numbers between the two zkEVMs.

Related: Polygon’s ‘holy grail’ Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet

The report also covers the development of new products, including Geometry’s Semacaulk, a new zero-knowledge set membership protocol that offers gas savings over Merkle-tree constructions, while ensuring proofs can be generated quickly and verified for roughly the same gas cost.

2022’s $7 million ZPrize competition helped drive innovation of ZK technology, with multiscalar multiplication (MSM) on Android mobile devices stemming from the development competition aimed at fostering ZK solutions. According to ZKValidator’s report, MSM improved proof generation time from 2.4 seconds to around half a second, making mobile payments in ZK easier.

Related: Zero-knowledge proofs coming to Bitcoin, overhauling network state validation

The report also mentioned a paper proposing a fast GPU-accelerated zero-knowledge proof system that reduces proof generation time in ZK-proofs by leveraging hardware similarities of GPUs. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have become highly useful hardware for cryptocurrency miners, given its ability to process data simultaneously, and its use for machine learning, video editing and gaming.

Various other zero-knowledge projects were also identified in the fields of decentralized identity, interoperability and payments within the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems in 2023.

This includes Telepathy, a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) interoperability protocol for Ethereum. The protocol allows users to read Ethereum state on any chain while retaining the security of Ethereum’s light client protocol.

Sismo Connect was also mentioned, which is a privacy-preserving single sign-on method for applications on both Web2 and Web3. The technology allows developers to implement ZK technology in their applications.

Lastly, the Manta Network also expanded its ZK capabilities, allowing for privacy support for nonfungible tokens and soul-bound tokens.

Investments were also highlighted, with Ethereum research and development firm The =nil; Foundation raising $22 million to continue the development of the Proof Marketplace. The solution allows layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains to outsource the production of ZK-proofs.

Zk-proof developer Proven raised $15.8 million in a seed round, while Polyhedra Network raised $10 million for its blockchain interoperability infrastructure platform.

Zero-knowledge rollups have been in the spotlight throughout the first quarter of 2023. Polygon released its open-source zkEVM Ethereum scaling technology to mainnet on March 27, while several Ethereum decentralized finance protocols have adopted zkSync since its alpha launch in March 2023.

A four-year-old video of United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Genser giving praise to smart contract platform Algorand 

ALGO

$0.17

 is circulating on Twitter following the SEC declaring that ALGO is an unregistered security.

In the video, Gensler referred to Algorand as a “great technology” while he was contemplating whether a “high performance” smart contract network would be capable of integrating an Uber or Lyft-like application on its platform.

ALGO is one of six tokens that Gensler claimed was an unregistered security in the SEC’s lawsuit against crypto trading platform Bittrex on April 17 that took issue with the Algorand Foundation's initial coin offering (ICO) of ALGO in June 2019.

Cryptocurrency researcher Mason Versluis was one of the first to highlight the video in an April 17 tweet criticizing Gensler for “shilling” ALGO, with others calling out the SEC chair for his apparent hypocrisy.

Gensler’s praise of Algorand was heard by an audience at a Massachusetts Institute of Technology () “Fintech Beyond Crisis” conference held on April 25, 2019.

Gensler worked as a professor of global economics and management at MIT prior to becoming the SEC’s chair, and he acknowledged former MIT colleague and Algorand founder Silvio Micali in the speech — who appeared to be in the crowd.

The video sparked Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran to question the long-standing advice from Gensler for crypto firms to register with the regulator.

""Surely if there is a path to register, a world renown MIT professor who personally knows the Chairman of the SEC can figure it out,"" Cochran tweeted on April 17.

Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett expects Gensler to be questioned over his Algorand comments in his upcoming testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on April 18.

Other critics choose to mock the situation at hand, highlighting the price decline of ALGO, which has seen a 93.8% decline since its launch, according to CoinGecko data.

It should be noted that ALGO didn’t hit the market until late June 2019, two months after Gensler’s speech.

Gensler stated in an April 17 tweet that it had been an “honor” to work at the SEC over the last two years and chose to highlight the 1,500 enforcement actions the regulator has undertaken since he’s been at the helm.

Gensler was sworn into office as SEC chair on April 17, 2021, after U.S. President Joe Biden’s nomination of Gensler was confirmed by the Senate on April 14, 2021.

Join us on social networks

Pullbacks are a part and parcel of uptrends. They not only help shake out the weaker hands but also offer an opportunity for traders to add to their position or make fresh entries. Currently, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 is witnessing a correction as bulls and bears battle for control, but is this a buying opportunity or the start of a trend reversal?

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has risen to 69, indicating that traders have started to get greedy again. When this happens, it is time to become cautious in the near term, as when new traders begin chasing prices higher, experienced traders sell into strength and buy on dips.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in a recent interview that Bitcoin and Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 are being considered safe-haven assets like gold. Meanwhile, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio does not consider Bitcoin to be “an effective store hold of wealth or a medium of exchange.” He called it “a very, very poor alternative to gold.” This shows that some legacy investors are still uncertain about the future prospects of Bitcoin.

Will traders buy the dip in Bitcoin and the major altcoins, or could the correction deepen further? Let’s study the charts to find out.

S&P 500 index price analysis

The S&P 500 index (SPX) has been gradually moving toward the overhead resistance at 4,200. The price action of the past few days has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above 4,200.

SPX daily chart. Source: TradingView

If that occurs, the index may start a new uptrend that has a target objective of 4,909. It is unlikely to be a straight dash higher because the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at 4,300 and then again at 4,625.

Another possibility is that the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance at 4,200 and slips below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) (4,070). The index may then drop to the uptrend line of the triangle. If this support gives way, the advantage may turn in favor of the bears.

U.S. Dollar Index price analysis

The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) bounced off the strong support at 100.82 on April 13, signaling that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.

DXY daily chart. Source: TradingView

The index has reached the 20-day EMA (102.32), where the bulls may face solid resistance from the bears. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will increase the possibility of a break below 100.82. The index will then complete a head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, which has a long-term target objective of 86.87.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price rises above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate strong buying near the 100.82 support. That may keep the index range-bound between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) (106.33) and 100.82 for some more time.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin turned down from $31,000 on April 14, indicating profit-booking by the bulls. The bears will try to take advantage of the situation and tug the price to the 20-day EMA ($28,937).

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.

The bulls will then make another attempt to propel the price to the stiff overhead resistance at $32,400. This remains the key level to watch for because a break and close above it may open the doors for a potential rally to $40,000.

This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA. That may embolden the bears, who will then try to sink the BTC/USDT pair to $27,800 and later to $26,500.

Ether price analysis

Ether is in an uptrend, but it is facing resistance near the critical overhead level of $2,200. This suggests that some short-term traders may be booking profits after the strong rally in the past few days.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ETH/USDT pair may dip down to the psychological support at $2,000 and then to the 20-day EMA ($1,930). In an uptrend, buyers generally try to defend the 20-day EMA during pullbacks.

In this case, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that lower levels are attracting buyers. That could enhance the prospects of a break above $2,200. If this level gives way, the pair may surge to $3,000.

Contrarily, if the price slumps below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are rushing to the exit. The pair may then descend to $1,680 and thereafter to the 200-day SMA ($1,482).

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$314

 continued its northward journey and soared above the $338–$346 overhead resistance zone on April 16. However, the bulls are finding it difficult to latch on to the higher levels.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are trying to pull the price back below the breakout level. If the price tumbles below $338, it may trap several aggressive bulls. That could result in a long liquidation, sinking the BNB/USDT pair to the 20-day EMA. If bulls want to keep the recovery intact, they will have to defend this level with vigor.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $350, it will indicate that bulls are in the driver’s seat. The pair may then climb to $360 and later to $400. This level is again likely to act as a formidable resistance.

XRP price analysis

After the failed attempt to thrust the price above the $0.56–$0.58 resistance zone on April 14, the bears are trying to start a correction in XRP 

XRP

$0.43

.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bears tug the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.50), the XRP/USDT pair may plunge to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.47. This level may witness strong buying by the bulls because if it cracks, the pair may collapse to the vital support at $0.43.

If bulls want to prevent this short-term bearish projection, they will have to drive the price above the overhead zone. If they do that, the pair may accelerate toward $0.65 and later extend the rally to $0.80.

Cardano price analysis

The up-move in Cardano’s ADA 

ADA

$0.366

 halted near $0.46. The price may turn down and retest the breakout level from the inverse H&S pattern.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The rising 20-day EMA ($0.40) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that bulls have the edge. If the price snaps back from the neckline, it will suggest that bulls have flipped the level into support. The ADA/USDT pair may then resume its uptrend toward the pattern target of $0.60.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and plunges below the neckline, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. That may trap several aggressive bulls and sink the pair to the 200-day SMA ($0.35).

Polygon price analysis

The bulls pushed Polygon’s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8801

 above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on April 16, but they are struggling to sustain the breakout.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bears succeed in pulling the price back below the resistance line, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. The MATIC/USDT pair may then extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days.

The 20-day EMA ($1.13) has turned up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are at a slight advantage. If the price turns up from the resistance line, it will indicate that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The pair may then rally to $1.30, where the bears may again mount a strong defense.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bears tried to stall Dogecoin’s 

DOGE

$0.07

 recovery at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.09 between April 14 to 16, but the buyers did not cede ground to the sellers.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The buyers asserted their supremacy and kicked the price above the overhead resistance on April 17, but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the sellers are protecting the 61.8% retracement level at $0.10.

Sellers will try to strengthen their position by dragging the price below the moving averages. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair may stay inside the large range between $0.07 and $0.11 for a few more days.

Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $0.10, it will suggest that bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair may then rise to the crucial resistance at $0.11. A break above this level will signal a possible pick-up in momentum.

Solana price analysis

Solana’s SOL 

SOL

$21

 has been sustaining above the downtrend line since April 11, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to guard the overhead resistance at $27.12.

If the price turns down sharply from this level, the SOL/USDT pair may fall to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will enhance the prospects of a rally toward $39.

On the contrary, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the pair may oscillate between $15.28 and $27.12 for a while longer.

SOL’s price dropped by over 4% to go under $24.50 despite rising to $26 — a two-month high — earlier in the day.

In comparison, BTC’s and ETH’s prices dropped 3.5% and 3%, respectively, hinting at a bearish start to the week.

SOL price in a technical correction

The SOL/USD selloff on April 17 started after it entered its 2023 resistance range.

Notably, the $25–$27 price area has capped SOL’s upside attempts since January 2023. Testing it as resistance has preceded 25%–40% corrections on multiple occasions this year, as illustrated below.

SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView

The possibility of undergoing a sharp bearish reversal in April has now increased as SOL’s price returns into the range and its daily relative strength index (RSI) hangs around the overbought threshold of 70.

In this bearish scenario, the immediate downside target appears to be around $20, about 20% lower than the current prices. 

Conversely, a decisive breakout above the $25–$27 price range could have SOL price climb toward $30, which served as support in August–October 2022.

Such a breakout could extend until $35 over the next few months, a level that coincides with SOL’s 50-week exponential moving average (the red wave in the chart below).

Grayscale Solana Trust goes public

On April 17, U.S.-based Grayscale Investments announced that its Grayscale Solana Trust had begun trading on OTC Markets under the symbol GSOL.

Related: Solana overcomes FTX fiasco — SOL price gains 100% in Q1

To recap, Grayscale Solana Trust is a security that derives its value from SOL’s spot price. In doing so, the trust enables investors to gain exposure in the Solana market while avoiding the challenges of buying, storing and safekeeping SOL directly.

Interestingly, SOL’s price dropped by up to 4.4% after the announcement, suggesting traders likely “sold the news” of an institutional Solana investment product going public. 

SOL/USD hourly price chart. Source: TradingView

One reason for the bearish debut for GSOL is the current state of Grayscale trusts on the whole. Notably, they act like closed-end funds, meaning Grayscale cannot issue new shares or remove shares from the open market to adjust to capital inflow or outflow.

As a result, the share price of the Solana trust can deviate from the net asset value. This could spook investors in a bear market when their GSOL starts trading at a discount versus the value of Grayscale’s SOL reserves, similar to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

As of April 17, Grayscale Solana Trust’s holdings per share were up around 148% year-to-date, stemming from identical gains in SOL/USD.

Tether has emerged as a clear winner amid the ongoing banking crisis and crypto crackdown in the United States.

On April 17, the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin's circulating market valuation reached nearly $81 billion, just 1.5% below its record high of $82.29 billion from a year ago. It has grown about 20% year-to-date (YTD) already and is now eyeing new all-time highs.

Tether rivals hit new yearly lows

Tether’s 

USDT

$1.00

 growth came as it ate up the market share of its stablecoin rivals, USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

 and Binance USD 

BUSD

$1.00

. That is due to crypto traders' belief that Tether’s operations have no exposure to the potential banking crisis contagion.

For instance, the circulating market capitalization of USD Coin, the second-largest stablecoin, has dropped over 25% YTD to $31.82 billion, its lowest level since October 2021, primarily due to its exposure to the failed Silicon Valley Bank. 

USDC market capitalization monthly chart. Source: TradingView

BUSD, on the other hand, has witnessed a 60% drop in market capitalization in 2023 to $6.68 billion, its lowest since April 2021, as the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos, a regional crypto firm, to stop its mint and issuance. 

Moreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asserts that BUSD is a “security.” Conversely, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges that the stablecoin is a “commodity.”

This capital shift likely helped Tether boost its dominance above 65% in the global stablecoin sector for the first time since May 2021, according to Glassnode data.

On April 16, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee published a draft version of its potential stablecoin bill to create definitions for issuers. It says that non-U.S. firms like Tether must register if they cater to Americans, albeit without mentioning the specific agency that would regulate stablecoins.

Exchange stablecoin supply lowest since June 2021

Despite Tether's market capitalization growth, its supply across crypto exchanges has been declining in 2023.

As of April 16, cryptocurrency exchanges had 12.94 billion USDT in their reserves compared with 17.89 billion USDT at the year’s beginning. On the whole, the stablecoin supply across exchanges has dropped 42% YTD to $21.53 billion.

This dynamic coincides with the 21% YTD increase in the crypto market's valuation from $1 trillion in January to $1.21 trillion, suggesting that Q1 has seen a trend shift from “safe” stablecoins to risk-on cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain technology needs a benchmark communications standard that can be easily integrated by every network in order for a complete transition from Web2 to Web3 to occur, industry commentators say.

Advertisement
Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

Many expect there will be multiple blockchains and such an ecosystem requires communication protocols similar to the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) used on the internet.

Ryan Lovell, director of capital markets at crypto price oracle solutions firm Chainlink Labs, told Cointelegraph that blockchains will need interoperability similar to how computers need the internet to transfer data and value across networks:

“To realize a fully interoperable blockchain ecosystem at scale, there needs to be an open communication standard analogous to the TCP/IP, which currently serves as the internet’s de facto connection protocol.”

Lovell believed a similar standard for blockchain networks would “pave the way for a seamless, internet-like experience” for the platform and their applications.

This is particularly important given that the last bull market saw a host of new layer-1 blockchains make their mark. However, nearly all of them operate in isolation from one another.

Lovell stressed that blockchain interoperability is “crucial” for financial institutions looking to tokenize real-world assets because that would ensure that liquidity isn’t “stifled” by only existing in a “siloed ecosystem.”

Brent Xu, the founder and chief executive of Umee — a lending platform backed by Cosmos’ Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) — told Cointelegraph that before real-world assets are brought on-chain, proper risk management systems need to be put in place to facilitate this interoperability.

Xu explained that financial institutions would need to tick off Know Your Client (KYC) credentials to ensure the authenticity of the real-world assets before being tokenized on-chain and then make sure that they can be identified by an on-chain proof-of-reserve audit.

In order to avoid an on-chain catastrophe, he stressed the risk of cutting corners simply isn’t worth it:

“Think of the ‘08 mortgage crisis. Tremendous financial value was lost due to a broken legacy system. Imagine if this value was ported into the blockchain ecosystem, we would see tremendous value loss due to the contagion.”

Cross-chain bridges, independent layer-2 sidechains and oracles are three of the most commonly used blockchain interoperability solutions to date. The first two operate solely on-chain, while the latter feeds off-chain data on-chain.

Related: Why interoperability is the key to blockchain technology’s mass adoption

There have been issues with some of these solutions, however, most notably cross-chain bridges.

An October report highlighted that half of all exploits in decentralized finance (DeFi) took place on a cross-chain bridge, the most notable example being the $600 million Ronin bridge hack in March 2022.

Xu noted that many of these hacks have come from multi-signature security setups or proof-of-authority consensus mechanisms, which are considered to be centralized and much more vulnerable to attack.

He added that many of these interoperability solutions favored “speed of development” over security early on, which backfired.

The key, Xu said, is to incorporate interoperability within the platform, as that will result in a more secure end-to-end transaction than through the use of third-party bridges:

“Bridges are particularly susceptible because they provide two ends at which hackers can potentially infiltrate any vulnerabilities.”

Among the most commonly used blockchain interoperability protocols are Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP); the IBC, which leverages the Cosmos ecosystem; Quant Network’s Overledger and Polkadot.

Update (April 17, 8:25 am UTC): This article has been updated to more accurately reflect an analogy from Ryan Lovell.

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,796

 and Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 are trading above the psychologically important levels of $30,000 and $2,000, respectively, suggesting the crypto winter may be on its last legs. 

Some analysts are calling for an altseason to begin, but it may be too early for that. When most crypto bears turn bullish, Bitcoin will likely turn down sharply and catch the late entrants off guard. That could hurt sentiment in the short term and cause a sell-off in altcoins. After the weak hands are shaken out, the crypto markets may stabilize and begin a sustained uptrend.

Data from on-chain intelligence platform Glassnode suggests that there are significant similarities between the current having cycle and the previous ones. However, Ecoinometrics warned that an economic recession could alter things.

Let’s watch the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical resistance levels that may start a pullback.

Bitcoin price analysis

The bears tried to stall the up-move on April 12 but the bulls did not give up. They resumed their purchases on April 13 and cleared the hurdle at $30,550 on April 14.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If buyers sustain the price above $30,550, the BTC/USDT pair may rally to $32,400. The bears are expected to protect this level with all their might.

If the price turns down from this level but does not break below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $28,542, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above $32,400. If this level is scaled, the pair may zoom toward $40,000.

On the other hand, if the 20-day EMA cracks, it will suggest that the bears are trying to make a comeback. That could clear the path for a possible drop to $25,250.

Ether price analysis

Ether bounced off the 20-day EMA ($1,870) on April 12, indicating that the bulls are vigorously guarding the level.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The buying continued on April 13, with the bulls pushing the price above the psychologically important level of $2,000. That attracted further buying, with the ETH/USDT pair climbing toward $2,200. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because if they fail to do that, the pair may witness a buying stampede. The pair could then skyrocket to $3,000.

Conversely, if the price turns down from $2,200 and breaks below $2,000, the pair may tumble to the 20-day EMA. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break below it may pull the pair to $1,680.

BNB price analysis

The bulls did not allow BNB 

BNB

$314

 to dip below the 20-day EMA ($317) on April 12 and 13. This indicates that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying the dips.

The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped above 60, suggesting that the tide is turning in favor of the bulls.

Buyers will try to solidify their position by catapulting the price above the $338 to $346 overhead zone. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair may pick up momentum and rally to $360 and subsequently to $400.

On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. That may keep the pair stuck between the 20-day EMA and $346 for some time.

XRP price analysis

Buyers successfully protected the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.49. That attracted further buying in XRP

, which pushed the price toward the overhead resistance zone of $0.56 to $0.58.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.49) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that bulls have a slight edge. If buyers kick the price above $0.58, the XRP/USDT pair may start an up-move that could reach $0.65 and then $0.80.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, it will suggest that the pair may consolidate between $0.49 and $0.58 for a few days. The trend will favor the bears if they yank the price below $0.49.

Cardano price analysis

 soared above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern on April 13, completing the reversal setup.

Usually, the price turns down after the breakout from a pattern and retests the breakout level. In this case, the ADA/USDT pair may dip to the neckline. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That may start an up-move toward the pattern target of $0.60.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below $0.37, it will suggest that the breakout above the neckline was a fake out. The pair may then plunge to $0.30.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

 bounced off the moving averages on April 12, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls tried to drive the DOGE/USDT pair above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.09 but the bears did not budge. This suggests that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.

Buyers must push and sustain the price above $0.09 to indicate that the selling pressure may be reduced. The pair may then ascend to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.10. Usually, a break and close above this level results in a 100% retracement. If that happens, the pair may soar to $0.11.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8801

 slipped below the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on April 12 but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The MATIC/USDT pair turned up and broke above the 20-day EMA ($1.11) on April 13. That may have trapped the aggressive bears, resulting in a short squeeze. The pair reached the resistance line of the triangle on April 14, where the bears are posing a strong challenge.

If bulls thrust the price above the triangle, the rally may reach the resistance at $1.30. This level may again prove to be a strong hurdle, but if crossed, the up-move could reach $1.60. This positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below $1.08.

Solana price analysis

The bulls have built upon the breakout from the downtrend line in Solana 

SOL

$21

. This shows demand at higher levels.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The rising 20-day EMA ($21.74) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate an advantage to buyers. The SOL/USDT pair could rise to $27.12, where the bears may mount a strong defense. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair may resume its climb toward $39.

On the downside, the downtrend line is the key level to watch out for. The bears must sink and sustain the price below the downtrend line to trap the aggressive bulls. The pair may then collapse to $15.28.

Polkadot price analysis

The long tail on the April 12 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($6.32). Polkadot 

DOT

$5.36

 continued its northward march and broke above the downtrend line on April 13 but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The DOT/USDT pair turned down from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.85, with the bears trying to tug the price back below the downtrend line. If they do that, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this level may sink the pair to the crucial support at $5.70.

Conversely, if the price turns up and closes above $6.85, it may propel the price to the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern. If bulls pierce this overhead resistance, the pair may start a new uptrend.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$80.38

 turned up from the 20-day EMA ($91) on April 13, indicating that the bulls continue to view the dips as a buying opportunity.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls tried to strengthen their position further by pushing the price above the immediate resistance at $96 on April 14 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that the bears are aggressively selling on rallies.

If bears yank the price below the 20-day EMA, it could trap several aggressive bulls. The LTC/USDT pair may then slump to $85. On the other hand, if the price turns up and sustains above $96, it will open the gates for a potential rally to $106.

Ethereum 

ETH

$1,855

 is witnessing a price breakout on the back of the successful Shanghai and Capella (Shapella) upgrades. The increased bullish sentiment after the upgrade led Ether price to hit a year-to-date high of $2,123 on April 14.

The Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem received more daily fees, growing 30% in 24-hours on April 14 in tandem with Ether’s price growth. With the increase in Ether fees, the Ethereum proof of stake (PoS) token economics have turned deflationary and revenue is up 32% in the past 24-hours.

Although the Ethereum network is showing positive momentum, regulators are trending toward taking swift action against the crypto sector. Debates on whether Ether is a security token under the Howey test continue combined with privacy concerns that an Ethereum researcher says staking reveals IP addresses. 

Let’s review a few of the reasons for Ether’s newfound strength.

Ethereum Shanghai was a success

The long-awaited Shapella upgrade was officially executed to mainnet on April 12.

The Shapella hardfork was first slated to commence on March 14. At the time, on-chain data suggested the Shanghai hard fork would not bring massive sell pressure, yet some analysts believed the newly unlocked supply would hinder Ether price.

The current trend post-Shapella unlock shows that a majority of validators are withdrawing only staking rewards, rather than the 32 Ether needed to continue running a node. By April 14, the amount of staked Ether only decreased by 0.2%.

Ether deposits spiked after the hardfork

Despite cumulative withdrawals outweighing Ethereum ecosystem deposits, 97,040 Ether has been staked in the previous 24-hours on April 14. The uptick in Ether staking deposits is a positive sign for the future of Ethereum post-Shapella.

On April 13, more than 70% of Ether stakers were underwater. After withdrawals and new depositors, the current Ether average staked price is $2,136. The gap reduction between the average staked price to the current Ether is closing, meaning that potentially soon a majority of Ethereum ecosystem stakers may be in profit.

, Ether and altcoins have led some analysts to declare the bottom is in. Bitcoin price set a year-to-date high of $31,014 on April 14, surpassing the psychologically important $31,000 level. 

While both Bitcoin and Ether price are up, Ether is gaining dominance versus Bitcoin and altcoins. Starting April 13, Ether increased its dominance to 19.37%, a 0.54% increase in 24-hours.

Ethereum’s dominance versus Bitcoin struggled to start 2023 but is quickly closing the gap. 

Investors’ 2023 expectations for Ethereum and the crypto market

Some analysts believe that although the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Inflation (PPI) prints show inflation slowing faster than expected but an Ether price dip in the near future is still possible. The highly regarded FedWatch tool still expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the May 3 Fed meeting.

Macro factors like inflation-caused interest rate hikes and potential U.S. industry crackdown will continue weighing on Ether’s price slightly hindering short-term price growth potential. Factors such as positive regulatory clarity and an easing of interest rate hikes may prove to be long-term catalysts for price growth. Ether’s price volatility is likely to continue.

Ethereum’s long-anticipated Shanghai and Capella upgrades were activated on April 12, and the total withdrawals in the first 40 hours following stood at 142,425 Ether 

ETH

$1,855

, per Nansen data. This falls in line with previous estimates.

For a brief moment on April 12, when Shapella was activated, the deposits to ETH staking contracts outpaced withdrawals. However, deposits have slowed down come April 13, while withdrawals are going strong.

ETH moved for withdrawals

Validators are required to update their staking software clients with withdrawal credentials changed to 0x01 from 0x00 and point to a valid Ethereum address. Once validators do that, partial withdrawals —i.e., withdrawals of rewards above 32 ETH — will be processed automatically.

At the time of writing, 70.1% of validators have changed to 0x01, with 407,851.20, worth over $850 million, set for withdrawal.

Additionally, 875,325 ETH (worth $1.85 billion) is waiting for full exit. Adding to the amount already processed in the first 40 hours, over 1.42 million ETH will be withdrawn from the staking contract.

ETH withdrawals will be rate limited to 1,800 validators per day, translating to a daily withdrawal of 57,600 ETH per day based on 32 ETH per validator. With 875,325 ETH waiting for full exit, it corresponds to potential daily selling pressure of between $120 million.

In the first three days, when partial withdrawals will be processed as well, the total daily withdrawals will be 136,000 ETH and 173,000 ETH per day.

However, the above statistics must be taken with a grain of salt because 62.8% are forced withdrawals from the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken in response to a $30 million settlement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to discontinue staking services.

There is a chance that a significant portion of Kraken withdrawals will move to decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido, Frax and Rocket Pool instead of being sold on the market.

Interestingly, Lido accounts for 56.07% of the withdrawals processed so far, which is slightly concerning, as previous estimates suggested that withdrawals from liquid staking derivative platforms like Lido would be minimal.

Currently, 9.6 million staked ETH is in profit, which will remain most vulnerable to a sell-off. It also remains to be seen if more illiquid stakers will move to withdraw their ETH, as they represent over 34% of the 17.4 million ETH deposited in total.

Ether price analysis

Technically, the ETH/USD pair looks bullish, having broken above the $2,000 resistance level. Buyers will look to target the support and resistance levels around $2,300 and the May 2022 breakdown levels at around $2,900. Short-term support to the downside lies at around $1,725.

The funding rates for ETH perpetual contracts are in neutral territory, deposit the price surge, per Coinglass data. Usually, neutral positioning of the perpetual market after a major price surge means that traders are not yet excited with the present rally, which is represented by a spike in positive funding rates. It also allows more upside room for prices.

However, given that there could be some spot selling pressure from the ETH withdrawals, it will likely restrict the uptrend in the market.

$27,795

 broke through $31,000 on April 14 as bulls hoped altcoins would soon follow.

Analyst eyes potential dip under $30,000 

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView captured new 10-month highs of $31,035 for BTC/USD on Bitstamp.

The pair had risen gradually the day before after a consolidatory period around new macroeconomic data prints from the United States.

These had furthered the bullish risk asset narrative, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Inflation (PPI) prints showing inflation slowing faster than expected.

While Bitcoin did not react immediately, the latest uptick reinforced market participants’ convictions over continued strength and a break with the long-term downtrend.

“Bitcoin looks strong, but will have some shallow corrections in an upward trend,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight forecasted on the day.

“I've marked $31.7-32K as important resistance point. However, $25K was the level everyone wanted to buy. This will probably shift to $28.5K, and then nobody buys. I'd prefer to focus on $29.7K.”

Van de Poppe referenced previous concerns over a deeper correction on BTC/USD, with nervous price targets including the 200-week moving average at around $25,500 and even $22,000.

Popular trader Crypto Tony nonetheless advised potential long position entries to wait until confirmation of new support levels.

“We have now crossed into the range of $31,000 EQ and $32,300 Range high,” part of the day’s Twitter analysis stated, alongside a chart showing the potential high, low and equilibrium (EQ) level of the new range.

“Altseason is underway”

Once again stealing the show, however, were altcoins, led by Ether

After teasing a reclaim of $2,000 the day prior, ETH/USD went on to hit $2,130, its highest level since May 2022.

Unsurprisingly, reactions were highly complimentary of the overall crypto market strength.

“With the $BTC bottom being in and our final 5th impulse confirmed (imo). I believe that the bottom is likely also in on a lot (not all) of alts,” popular trader Credible Crypto summarized, referring to a theory from a recent YouTube video.

“Coins like $ETH and various others have likely seen their lows and have started the journey to new all time highs.”

Credible Crypto acknowledged that it was Bitcoin “in the drivers seat mid-term,” and that it would take a cooling off for BTC price action to stimulate rapid altcoin growth.

That said, the sentiment was peppered with references to “altseason” on the day, including from former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes.

Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro likewise declared altseason “underway,” noting the total altcoin market cap adding $62 billion in two weeks.

Others variously referenced “mini altseason” and “altseason 2.0,” arguing that copycat gains on altcoins should follow an initial surge led by Bitcoin.
